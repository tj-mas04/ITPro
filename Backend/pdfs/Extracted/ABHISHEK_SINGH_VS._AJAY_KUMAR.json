OF 2025  \n(Arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.480 /2025 )  \n \n \nABHISHEK SINGH                      … APPELLANT (S) \n \nVersus  \n \nAJAY KUMAR  & ORS.                   … RESPONDENT (S) \n \n \n \nJ U D G M E N T  \n \n \n \nSANJAY KAROL, J.  \n \nLeave Granted.  \n2.  The appellant, Abhishek Singh,  is the complainant and \nhas approached this Court  aggrieved by the judgment  and order Crl.A@ SLP(Crl) No. 480/2025                                                                   Page 2 of 11 \n dated 12th November , 2024 , passed by the High Court of \nJudicature at Patna in Criminal Miscellaneous No.678 84 of \n2023 , whereby the respondent s’ application under Section 482 \nof the Code of Criminal Procedure , 19731 was allowed and the \nFirst Information Report dated 7th September 2023 filed by him \nunder Sections 420, 406 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code , \n18602, being  Mithanpura P .S. Case No.393 of 2023 , was \nquashed.  \n3.  The brief facts that gave rise to this appeal , as set out by \nthe Courts below,  are that the appellant , being a businessman by \nvocation, was in need of certain funds which he secured by way \nof a loan from the Bank of India, Motijhil Branch. Having \npledged 254 g rams  of 22 carat gold ornaments  by way of \nsecurity , a loan of ₹ 7 ,70,000 was made in his favour , on 22nd \nJuly, 2020 . The dispute arises when it comes to the repayment \nof this loan. According to the appellant, upon receipt of notice \ndated 7th  October , 2022 from the bank asking him to pay a sum \nof ₹ 8 ,01,383.59 , which included interest, he repaid the same as \non 31st March , 2023. Unbeknownst to him, the bank conducted \na revaluation of the gold pledged by him and, to that end, \ndeducted ₹ 1500 towards fees. His applications for returning the \npledged gold fell on deaf years. On the other hand, according to \n \n1 Cr.P.C. \n2 IPC Crl.A@ SLP(Crl) No. 480/2025                                                                   Page 3 of 11 \n the bank, he did not pay the loan, because of which the gold \nbecame an asset of the bank .  In order to realise the money \ninvolved in the transaction , the said gold was revalued  and \nfound to be counterfeit  when it was allegedly reported by a \nvaluer , different from the one who had originally valued the \nappellant’s gold when the loan was made , that the material \npledged was not gold in actuality but gold plated on top of other \nmetals.  One FIR was registered under sections 420 and 379 IPC \nagainst the appellant on 22nd May, 2023.  Another FIR, subject \nmatter of this appeal , was registered subsequently after  an \napplication was made by the appellant to the competent \nauthority under Section 156(3) of the Cr .P.C.  Respondent  No.1 , \nthe Accused therein,  was the Branch and Credit Manager at the \ntime of the revaluation of the appellant's gold.  \n4.  Having completed its investigation into the appellant’s \nallegations, the investigating authorities filed a chargesheet \nbefore the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class (East) Mithanpura , \nhaving the particulars as Final Report/Chargesheet No.371/24 , \ndated 30th September , 2024. While the investigation was still \nunderway , the respondent s filed an application seeking quashing \nof the FIR on  5th October , 2023.  It is in this application that the \nimpugned judgment  came to be passed.  \n5.  The High Court, having p erused  the material on record , \ncame to the following conclusions  : Crl.A@ SLP(Crl) No. 480/2025                                                                   Page 4 of 11 \n a) this FIR is “a mere counterblast” to the FIR lodged by the \nbank;  \nb) the same has been lodged with the intention of causing \nwrongful loss to the bank and wrongful gain to himself;  \nc) to this end, the respondent  before the High Court, the \nappellant herein , had obtained a loan from the bank for \npledging  spurious gold ornaments;  \nd) the institution of the FIR was “with an ulterior motive \nand also as an afterthought”;  \ne) even if the contents of the complaint are taken at face \nvalue, no offence is made out.  \nf) The Court relied upon paragraphs  29 to 31 of  Priyanka \nSrivastava v. State of UP3 to hold that since the appellant \nhad not affixed any affidavit as mandated by this \njudgment, the FIR was unsustainable;  \ng) Continuation of criminal proceedings against the \nrespondents herein would amount to an abuse of process \nof the Court, given that the complain t made by the \nappellant herein was “malicious”.  \n6. In that view of the matter, the FIR was quashed , and the \nappellant carried the matter to this Court. \n \n3 (2015) 6 SCC 287  Crl.A@ SLP(Crl) No. 480/2025                                                                   Page 5 of 11 \n 7.  We have heard the learned Senior counsel appearing for \nthe parties and have gone through the record in detail.  It is \nsought to be contended by the appellant, inter alia , that :  \na) the High Court failed to appreciate that as on 31st \nMarch , 2023 , there was no outstanding loan , against \nwhich the process of recovery could have been \ninitiated;  \nb) in the impugned judgment , reliance was placed on \ndocuments other than the FIR/complaint which would \nbe outside its scope. Other documents , which may be \nof the nature of defence of the party against whom \nallegations have been made in the FIR , cannot be \nlooked into;  \nc) the re valuation of the appellant’s pledged gold was \ndone behind his back and contrary to the terms of the \nloan agreement. The possibility of tampering with or \nreplacing the ornaments with those  of questionable \nquality cannot be ruled out;  \nd) the complaint made under section 156 (3)  Cr.P.C. dated \n24th May, 2023 did have an affidavit attached to it , and \ntherefore , the findings made in Paras 33 to 35, are \nerroneous;  Crl.A@ SLP(Crl) No. 480/2025                                                                   Page 6 of 11 \n e) the non -lodging of FIR against the 1st valuer, which , \naccording to the respondents , was entirely incorrect, \nraises suspicion ; \nf) the charge on the appellant’s account without consent \nor prior notice amounts to fraud and cheating.  \n          Per contra, the respondents c anvassed, amongst others, \nthe following aspects  : \na) the gold loan account of the appellant had been \ndeclared a non -performing asset firstly on 1st of May , \n2021 but then upon payment , the same was again \nupgraded to standard. Subsequent non -payment led to \nits declaration as an NPA once again on 30th April, \n2022.  \nb) The amount deposited by the appellant on issuance of a \nrecall notice was not sufficient for the account to be \nupgraded again and , as such , the gold pledged by the \nappellant was revalued.  \nc) Upon finding that the 1st gold valuer had possibly \ncommitted fraud, his de -empanelment was made.  \nd) At the time of granting of loan to the appellant the \nrespondents herein were not posted at the relevant \nlocation but were only present at the time of \nrevaluation.  Crl.A@ SLP(Crl) No. 480/2025                                                                   Page 7 of 11 \n e) The appellant deliberately allowed the loan to become \nan NPA , since he knew that the ornaments alleged were \nfake. \nf) In the 1st recall notice dated 30th July, 2022 issued to \nthe appellant , it had been clearly stated that if he failed  \nto deposit the dues within 15 days, the bank would take \nsteps to auction the gold jewellery.  The appellant did \nnot respond. This  shows the clear intention on the part \nof the appellant to cheat.  \n8.  We have given our consideration to the multifarious \narguments advanced at the bar.  \n9.  The scope of the Court’s power to quash and set aside \nproceedings is well -settled to warrant any restatement. While \nthe arguments advanced have the potential to raise many issues \nfor consideration, we must first satisfy ourselves as to the \npropriety of the exercise of such power by the High Court.  The \ntask of the High Court, when called upon to adjudicate an \napplication seeking to quash  the proceedings, is to see whether, \nprima facie , an offence is made out or not.  It is not to examine \nwhether the charges may hold up in the Court.  In doing so, the \narea of action is circumscribed.  In Rajeev Kourav v. \nBaisahab4, it was held  : \n \n4 (2020) 3 SCC 317  Crl.A@ SLP(Crl) No. 480/2025                                                                   Page 8 of 11 \n “8. It is no more res integra that exercise of power \nunder Section 482 CrPC to quash a criminal proceeding \nis only when an allegation made in the FIR or the \ncharge -sheet constitutes the ingredients of the \noffence/offences alleged. Interference by the High \nCourt under Section 482 CrPC is to prevent the abuse \nof process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends \nof justice. It is settled law that the evidence produced \nby the accused in his defence cannot be looked into by \nthe court, except in very exceptional circumstances, at \nthe initial stage of the criminal proceedings. It is trite \nlaw that the High Court cannot embark upon the \nappreciation of evidence while considering the petition \nfiled under Section 482 CrPC for quashing criminal \nproceedings. It is clear from the law laid down by this \nCourt that if a prima facie case is made out disclosing \nthe ingredients of the offence alleged against the \naccused, the Court cannot quash a criminal \nproceeding. ” \n \n10.  A reference may also be made to the recent decision of \nthis Court in Naresh Aneja v. State of U.P .5, where it was held \nthat : \n“18. It is well settled that when considering an \napplication under Section 482CrPC, the court cannot \nconduct a mini -trial but instead is to be satisfied that \nprima facie the offences as alleged are made out. To put \nit differently, it is to be seen, without undertaking a \nminute examination of the record, that there is some \nsubstance in the allegations made which could meet the \nthreshold of statutory language. ” \n \n \n5 (2025) 2 SCC 604  Crl.A@ SLP(Crl) No. 480/2025                                                                   Page 9 of 11 \n 11.  In the present case, the Court has not only taken note of \nthe fraud (prevention and detection) risk management policy of \nthe bank  but has also factored in the removal of the 1st valuer to \ncome to the conclusion that there is an absence of malafides  on \nthe part of  the bank.   It has also come to the findings on merits \nthat the appellant undertook the entire process of securing a \nloan from the bank with ill intention. We are at a loss to \nunderstand as to how such a conclusion was arrived at, for the \nsettled position is that for determining intention, evidence has to \nbe taken into account.  In a similar vein, how the Court \nconcluded  that the appellant had an ulterior motive, is unclear.  \n12.  That apart,  even though the account of the appellant was \ndeclared a s NPA in April and despite the deposition of some \namount  it could not be upgraded to a standard account, the path \navailable to the bank to auction off the gold was admittedly not \ntaken.  The first recall notice was not answered. The second \nrecall notice was issued.  The time granted was 15 days, but the \npayment was made much thereafter, on 22nd November.  The \nrevaluation report is of February , 2023 , i.e., much after the \npayment had been made and the loan stood settled.  Both letters \naddressed by the appellant to the officials of the bank seeking  \nreturn of the pledged gold were  subsequent to the full and final \npayment , i.e., on 3rd April , 2023 and 25th April , 2023.  Crl.A@ SLP(Crl) No. 480/2025                                                                   Page 10 of 11 \n 13.  It is true that the appellant repaid the amount , but with \nsubstantial delay.  However , once the loan is settled, it is \ndifficult to understand as  to why the gold was rev alued and \nauctioned.   \n14.  Still further, the discussion made by the High Court in \nquashing the FIR in no way addresses the possibility of the \nrespondents’ possible involvement in the misappropriation of \nthe gold pledged. There was no third -party  verification \nundertaken by the bank to corroborate the findings returned by \nthe 2nd valuer , so it cannot be positively ruled out, without \nappreciat ing the evidence, that all the persons involved from the \nbank or outside (valuers) did  not commit any act affecting \nappellant’s pledged gold.   In any event, at all times the appellant \nhad no access  to the gold  which , after its initial  valuation , was \nalways kept in the safe custody of the bankers.  Fraud, if any, \nwhether  perpetrated at the first instance of valuation , or later , is \na matter which could be un earthed o nly after a trial based on the \nevidence led by the parties.  But, as of now, in no \ncircumstances , it can be said that  no prima facie  case regarding \ncommission of an offence, as alleged in the FIR , is made out \nfrom its perusal.    \n15.  In that view of the matter, we hold that the High Court \nhad improperly quashed the proceedings initiated by the \nappellant. It stands clarified that we have not expressed an y Crl.A@ SLP(Crl) No. 480/2025                                                                   Page 11 of 11 \n opinion on the matter, and the guilt or innocence of the \nrespondents has to be established in the trial , in accordance with \nthe law.  The proceedings out of the subject FIR, mentioned in \nparagraph 2 are revived and restored to the file of the concerned \nCourt. \n16.  The appeal is allowed. The Registry is directed to \ncommunicate a copy of this order to the learned Registrar \nGeneral, High Court of Judicature at Patna , who shall send \nforthwith a copy of this order to the concerned Court for \nnecessary action.  \nPending applications, if any, shall stand closed.  \n \n……………….J.  \n(Sanjay Karol)       \n \n \n \n……………….J.  \n(Manoj Misra)                    \n5th June , 2025 ; \nNew Delhi ."
