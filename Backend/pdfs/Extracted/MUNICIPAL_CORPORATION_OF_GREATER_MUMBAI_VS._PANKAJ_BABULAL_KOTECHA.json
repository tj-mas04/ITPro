The fulcrum of the present controversy centres around  the \nredevelopment of a theme park undertaken by  the Municipal \nCorporation of Greater Mumbai  (MCGM ) on a plot bearing CTS No. \n417, situated  at Khajuria Tank Road, Kandivali (West), Mumbai \n(Subject Property ). This redevelopment allegedly resulted in the \nobliteration of a lake that had existed at the premises for \napproximately 100 years.   \nPage 2 of 16 \n 3. This issue was assailed before the High Court of Bombay ( High \nCourt ) vide a Writ Petition instituted in public interest , wherein by \nway of its judgement  dated 03.08.2018 , the High Court  allowed the \nsame and directed  Respondent No s. 2-8 herein  (State \nGovernment ) to assume  possession of the Subject Property , \ndemolish the construction  in question  and restore the lake claimed \nto have existed  prior to  the subject development  (Impugned \nJudgement ).  \nA. FACTS \n4. In order to shed light on the circumstances leading up to the \npassing of the Impugned Judgement, we deem it appropriate to \nbriefly set out the factual narration herewith:  \n4.1. A water body known as the Khajuria Lake used to be situated in \nthe same vicinity as the Subject Property. This water body, which \nhad existed for over 100 years, allegedly also served as a site for \nGanesh idol immersion during festivals. As per the revenue record, \nthe Subject Property was enlisted as belonging to the State \nGovernment through the Collector, Mumbai Suburban District.  \n4.2. It appears that in 2008, as part of a directive from the Additional \nMunicipal Commissioner (City) to develop Theme Gardens in \nvarious wards  within the city of Mumbai and other ancillary areas , \nMCGM  selected the Subject Property for development. MCGM   \nPage 3 of 16 \n claimed that the lake was in an unused and bad condition , so much \nso that  it was treated as a garbage disposal area , thereby prompting \nit to be identified for beautification and conversion into a \nrecreational space.  \n4.3. MCGM  in furtherance of th is objective , floated a tender on \n08.02.2008 for the development and maintenance of gardens, \nrecreation grounds, and other municipal plots. Following the \ntender  process, M/s. Techno Trade Impex India Pvt. Ltd. was \nappointed as the contractor on 10.04.2008. The project thereafter  \nreceived formal approval from the Standing Committee  of MCGM  \nvide SCR No. 729 , for the execution of beautification work  upon the \nSubject Property, on 24.08.2009 .  \n4.4. Subsequently, MCGM  appointed an architect to prepare detailed \nplans and estimates for the proposed beautification of the Subject \nProperty . Accordingly, a budget of Rs. 5 crores came to be allocated  \nby MCGM  in the fiscal year of 2008 -09.  \n4.5. However, as already observed, given that the Subject Property \nbelonged to the Collector and not MCGM , the latter submitted an \napplication for  a No Objection Certificate to the Collector on \n30.06.2009 seeking permission for the project . Notwithstanding the \npendency of th ese request s, the beautification work proceeded, and \nthe transformed recreational space  comprising the planned green  \nPage 4 of 16 \n cover, musical water fountain, and recreational amenities  was \ncompleted and inaugurated for public use in December 2011 . On \n23.05.2012,  MCGM  sent another letter to the Collector for transfer \nof the property , which remained unanswered.  \n4.6. Thereafter, the publication of a news report in the Times of India \ndaily newspaper on 06.09.2012 concerning  the alleged filling up of \nKhajuria Lake spurred action in Respondent No. 1, who being a \npublic -spirited  individual , filed a Writ Petition before the High \nCourt on 29.11.2012. The petition sought demolition of the \nconstruction undertaken by MCGM  and restoration of the lake to \nits pristine condition, highlighting that this century -old water body \nserved as a habitat for various types of rare fish and tor toises, \nattracted different types of birds, and was surrounded by \nmangroves —all of which were decimated during the development of \nthe project . \n4.7. Significantly, during the pendency of the  petition , the Collector \nissued post facto  sanction dated 10.02.2014 approving the project, \nviz. the beautification of Khajuria pond , and transferring the \nSubject Property  to MCGM .  \n4.8. As already elucidated, the High Court , vide the Impugned \nJudgment dated 03.08.2018, allowed the Writ Petition . Being \naggrieved , MCGM  has preferred the instant appeal.   \nPage 5 of 16 \n 4.9. Notably, d uring the pendency of the instant appeal , this Court, vide \norder dated 16.11.2018 , directed  status quo , thereby staying the \nimplementation of the Impugned Judgment. Consequently, the \nrecreational park continues to exist and function in its present \nform.  \nB. CONTENTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS  \n5. Mr. Dhruv Mehta, Learned Senior Counsel appearing for MCGM , \nvehemently contested the High Court ’s characterization of the \nSubject Property  as a lake requiring restoration.  He submitted that \nthe Impugned Judgment fundamentally misapprehended the \nnature of the land by disregarding that the Subject Property was \nalready reserved as R ecreation Ground or ‘R.G.’  in the sanctioned \nDevelopment Plan of 1991. It was urged that this reservation was \nmade following due statutory process , including inviting public \nobjections and suggestions through the Gazette Notification dated \n13.04.1984, and no objections were ever raised by any party , \nincluding the Respondent. It was further emphasized that such \n‘R.G.’ designation, read in conjunction with MCGM ’s statutory \nmandate to develop recreational spaces, provided sufficient legal \nfoundation for the beautification initiative sought to be undertaken, \nwhich has resulted in the creation of substantial green cover at the \nSubject Property .  \nPage 6 of 16 \n 6. Additionally, our attention was drawn to the documented usage \npattern of the Subject Property , highlighting that it had \nconsistently hosted community events , including Ganesh festival \ncelebrations with proper administrative permissions — \ncircumstances incompatible with the existence of a natural lake as \nalleged by Respondent No. 1 . It was detailed as to  how MCGM  had \ntransformed what was formerly a degraded area used as a garbage \ndumping ground , into a beneficial public amenity featuring \napproximately 200 tre es, a musical fountain , and recreational \nfacilities , presently  serving the local community without charge. He \ninsisted that , far from constituting illegal construction, the project \nrepresents a responsible exercise of MCGM  to enhance urban \nrecreational infrastructure, thereby promoting  rather than \ndiminishing public welfare in accordance with the Subject \nProperty’s  designated purpose.  \nC. CONTENTIONS ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT NO.1  \n7. Per contra , Mr. Kunal Cheema, Learned Counsel for Respondent \nNo. 1, strenuously opposed the appeal on multiple grounds. He \ncommenced his submissions by challenging the very premise of the \ndevelopment, asserting that the documentary evidence \noverwhelmingly established the existence of a functional water \nbody at the Subject Property. Relying on MCGM ’s own  \nPage 7 of 16 \n correspondence, particularly its letter dated 30.06.2009 seeking \npermission to convert the ‘Khajuria Talao to that of a municipal \ngarden ’, it was  contended that such language constituted an \nunequivocal admission that negated any subsequent attempt to \ndeny the lake ’s existence.  It was  further argued that the \nbeautification project represented nothing short of ecological \ndestruction, resulting in the obliteration of a century -old lake that \nsupported various aquatic species and attracted diverse birdlife to \nits surrounding mangroves.  \n8. On the aspect of  post facto  sanction of 2014, the Learned Counsel \ncharacterized it as a legally impermissible attempt to \nretrospectively legitimize an unauthorized act. It was  assailed  that \nthis sanction, granted during the pendency of litigation and years \nafter the construction ’s completion, suffered from inherent \ncontradictions —purporting to approve beautification while \nsimultaneously prohibiting the very change in land use that had \nalready been effected. In conclusion, Learned Counsel submitted \nthat the principles of environmental protection and the public trust  \ndoctrine mandated the restoration of the natural water body, as \nrightly held by the High Court.  \n \n  \nPage 8 of 16 \n D. ANALYSIS  \n9. Having h eard learned counsels for the parties and after perus al of \nthe material on record , we are of the considered view that the \nprimary question in the instant appeal  pertains to whether a \nrecreational park developed on an alleged historical water body \nought to be demolished and the water body restored or \nalternatively, whether the development warrants preservation given \nits current utility and the inexorable passage o f time. More \nspecifically, the question of achieving a judicious balance between \nenvironmental conservation and development for public welfare \nconstitutes the primary issue befo re us . That being said, at the very \noutset, we deem it pertinent to delineate the reasoning that \ninformed the High Court ’s determination in the matter.  \n10. Upon perus al of the Impugned Judgement, it becomes patently \nclear that t he High Court ’s reasoning rested primarily on the public \ntrust doctrine, whereby it held that the State c ould not permit the \ndestruction of natural water bodies under any circumstances. \nFurthermore, it found the post facto  sanction legally ineffective, as \nit attempted to retrospectively validate an unauthorized act while \nsimultaneously prohibiting the very land use change that had \nalready occurred. Consequently, invoking Articles 48A an d 51A(g) \nof the Constitution, the High Court concluded that the preservation  \nPage 9 of 16 \n of water bodies constitutes an absolute constitutional mandate that \ninvariably supersedes developmental considerations or temporal \nfactors.  \n11. In this light , we must acknowledge that albeit  the High Court’s \nviews were well -intentioned and prima facie  the correct \ninterpretation of settled notions such as the public trust doctrine , \nthey nonetheless warrant reconsideration through the prism of \npractical realities and evolved ground conditions. This Court has \nconsistently propounded that environmental jurisprudence must \nevolve contextually, taking into account both ecological imperatives \nand developmen tal exigencies. Indeed, there cannot be a simplistic \nbinary choice between a park or a pond, as each serves distinct \necological and social functions continge nt upon specific \ncircumstances, geographical location, and evolving usage patterns.  \n12. To put it simplistically, t he public trust doctrine establishes that \ncertain environmental resources are held in trust by the State for \nthe unimpeded enjoyment of the public  and for posterity . Although \nthe doctrine imposes a legal obligation upon governmental \nauthorities to protect these resources for public benefit and \necological sustainability, extending to public lands, parks, forests, \nwater bodies, wetlands, and other areas acquired by the  State, its \napplication must necessarily be calibrated according to the factual  \nPage 10 of 16 \n matrix and contemporary public needs. The doctrine , thus, does \nnot operate in isolation but must be harmonized with the objectives \nof sustainable development and evolving public welfare priorities.  \n13. When juxtaposed with the facts at hand, the instant case presents \na unique situation where one public amenity has been transformed \ninto another that continues to serve the community  \nunconditionally . Unlike scenarios involving the diversion of public \nresources for exclusive private benefit, we must examine whether \nthis particular transformation necessarily violates the trust \nobligation, considering three critical factors: (i) the prior condition \nof the water body ; (ii) the current ecological value of the par k; and \n(iii) the feasibility of remedial measures.  \n14. With respect to the first factor, while the material on record \nacknowledges the historical existence of a water body at the Subject \nProperty, it does not conclusively establish that this water body \nremained a functio nal pond by the relevant time. The affidavits filed \nby officials of MCGM  categorically aver that when work for the \nproject commenced in 2009, the Subject Property existed in an \nabandoned and dilapidated state, having deteriorated into a \ngarbage dumping ground that had completely lost its original \ncharacter as a water body.  Pertinently, nothing has been pleaded \nor placed on record to demonstrate that the Subject Property was  \nPage 11 of 16 \n ever a functional pond with significant water content, possessed \nany natural catchment area to draw fresh water, or performed \nmeaningful ecological functions beyond occasional ceremonial \nusage, thereby raising fundamental questions about its viability as \na sustainable aquatic ecosystem capable of supporting flora and \nfauna . \n15. As regards the current ecological value, the photographic evidence \nplaced before us vividly illustrates the Subject Property as a \nverdant, well -maintained urban oasis replete with numerous \nmature trees and recreational facilities actively utilized by the \ncommunity across all demographic segments. It bears particular \nemphasis that we are adjudicating this appeal in 2025, nearly \nfifteen years after the park became functional. During this extended \ntemporal span, an entire generation of children has grown up wi th \nthis green space as an integral component of their daily existence ,  \nwhilst the trees planted during the initial beautification have \nthemselves matured into substantial specimens that now \ncontribute significantly to the local ecosystem . The park serves as \na vital recreational nucleus for children, offering safe spaces for \nplay and physical activity; for senior citizens, providing dedicated \nareas for walking and social interaction; and for families, creating \nopportunities for community enga gement and leis ure.  \nPage 12 of 16 \n 16. The recreational park presently delivers substantial public benefits \nthat cannot be overlooked. It provides an essential green space in \nan increasingly concretized urban environment, with trees and \nother foliage contributing significantly to oxygen generation, air \npurification, and microclimate regulation. The ornamental water \nfeatures , such as the fountain, though admittedly not equivalent to \na natural water body, nonetheless contribute to biodiversity.  \n17. Be that as it may , the implementation of the High Court ’s direction \nat this juncture would engender consequences that contravene the \nvery environmental principles it seeks to uphold. The demolition \nwould necessitate the removal of numerous trees, causing \nimmediate environmental degradation requiring decades to \nremediate. Additionally, the expenditure of approximately Rs. 5 \ncrores of public funds would be rendered nugatory, with further \nsubstantial public expenditure requi red for the proposed \nrestoration. Su ch an outcome would create a paradox wherein \nenvironmental restoration results in greater ecological harm than \nthe original transformation —a classic case of  counterproductive \nremedial intervention . Most important ly, given the absence of any \nnatural catchment area as aforenoted, we are constrained to \nobserve that even if a pond were to be recreated, its sustainability \nand maintenance would remain highly questionable, with the  \nPage 13 of 16 \n distinct possibility of such stagnant water bod y becoming health \nhazards for the local populace, particularly during  the monsoon \nseasons when such properties are prone to becoming breeding \ngrounds for disease -carrying vectors . \n18. Beyond these substantive aspects, the Collector’s  post facto  \nsanction of 2014 merits separate consideration. The High Court \nfound this sanction to be procedurally deficient and contradictory —\nattempting to validate an unauthorized construction yet \nsimultaneously prohibiting the very land use change that had \noccurred . In this specific context , we observe that the larger \nquestion for adjudication before us transcends the validity of this \nbelated approval. Even assuming the sanction ’s invalidity, the \nfundamental issue remains whether restoration is feasible or \ndesirable , given  the passage of considerable time and the \nestablishment of a functioning public amenity. The legal status of \nthe 2014 sanction, therefore, though relevant to the question of \ninitial authorization, cannot be determinative of the appropriate \nremedy at this stage. More significantly, even if there existed some \nirregularity or perceived illegality in the post facto  sanction, such \nconcerns have been reasonably addressed and balanced by the \nspecific rider imposed therein restricting any change in land use . \nThe sanction , as it stands, thus ensures  that the Subject Property  \nPage 14 of 16 \n shall remain dedicated exclusively to recreational purposes in \nperpetuity. This rider provides the necessary legal safeguard and \npermanency to guarantee that the land may not be diverted for any \nother purpose, commercial or otherwise . \n19. As a final consideration, the delay in seeking judicial intervention \nsignificantly undermines the foundation of the High Court ’s \nimpugned decision . The beautification project commenced in 2008 \nand reached completion by 2011, with the park becoming fully \noperational for public use. However, the petition was instituted \nbefore the High Court towards the tail end  of 2012 —nearly five \nyears after the project ’s commencement and well after its \ncompletion. It is well -settled that environmental grievances must \nbe raised prompt ly when alleged violations commence, not after \ntransformative changes have materialized and become entrenched. \nThis considerable delay has created an irreversible fait accompli \nwherein substantial public resources have been expended , and a \nthriving recreational facility has become integral to community life. \nNo public purpose , therefore , would be served by undoing what \ntime and usage have legitimized through community acceptance \nand reliance.  \n20. For the foregoing reasons, we are constrained to hold that t he High \nCourt ’s direction to restore the Subject Property to its original  \nPage 15 of 16 \n condition as a pond, though made with laudable intentions, fails to \naccount for the transformed reality and the substantial public \nbenefit derived from the current recreational space.  \nE. CONCLUSION AND DIRECTIONS  \n21. In view thereof , we allow the instant appeal and set aside the \nImpugned Judgment passed by the High Court. Consequently, to \nensure ecological balance within the larger urban ecosystem and \npreser ve the existing park, we direct MCGM  to: \ni. Maintain and preserve the existing park in perpetuity as a \ngreen space exclusively for public use without any \npredominant commercial activity ;  \nii. Constitute an Expert Committee  within three months  to \nexplore the feasibility of developing an alternative water body \nin nearby areas to compensate for the ecological functions of \nthe original water body ; \niii. Undertake comprehensive ecological restoration of \ndeteriorated water bodies within the municipal jurisdiction \nwithin a period of twelve months ; and \niv. File a compliance report before th e High  Court every six \nmonths for a period of t hree years.  We request the High Court \nto see that the directions issued hereinabove are complied with \nin true letter and spirit.   \nPage 16 of 16 \n 22. The Government, being entrusted with the welfare of public spaces \nand environmental resources, bears the inherent responsibility to \npursue sustainable urban development practices that balance \ninfrastructural needs with ecological preservation. We thus clarify \nthat this order shall not preclude the State Government from \nimplementing any other additional measures for the overall \nimprovement of environmental quality in the Navi Mumbai area in \nharmony with the directions issued herein above .  \n23. Ordered accordingly, Pending applications, if any, also stand \ndisposed of in the above terms.  \n \n \n..........................J.  \n                          (SURYA KANT)\n    \n \n        \n             ………….………………..........................J.  \n        (NONGMEIKAPAM KOTISWAR SINGH)  \n  \nNEW DELHI;  \nDated: May 30, 2025"
