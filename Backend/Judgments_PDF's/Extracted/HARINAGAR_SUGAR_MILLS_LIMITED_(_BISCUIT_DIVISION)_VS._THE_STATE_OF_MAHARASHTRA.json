For manufacturing biscuits for \nBritannia Industries Ltd., the raw material as well as \nnecessary plant and machinery used to b e provided and \ninstalled by Britannia Industries Ltd.   After receiving \ntermination of Job work agreement from BIL, the \nCompany Immediately persuaded the management of \nBIL to continue agreement and the job work with the \nCompany.  However, said persuasion did not work or \nyield any result.  The Company had then approached \nother biscuit manufacturers such as M/s. Mondelez India CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 11 of 44 \n Limited and Us. ITC Ltd.  On 15.07.2019, the top \nmanagement of the Company had meeting with Mr. T. \nArunkumar, CMO, Manager of M/s. Mondelez India \nLimited and then as per his requirement had forwarded \ne-mail on 24.07.2109.  However, thereafter there was no \nresponse.  Similarly the top management of the \nCompany had discussed with Mr. Divi of M/s. ITC, \nFoods.  However, on 17.07.2019 Mr. Div replied that \nthere is no requirement of contract manufacturing unit to \nthem at present.  Once again on 24.07.2019 mail wa s \nforwarded to Mr. Divi of M/s. ITC Foods but there was \nno response to the said mail.  We enclose copies of e -\nmails forwarded to M/s. Mondelez India Ltd. and Ms. \nITC Foods The management of the Company had also \ntalked and discussed with Mr. Ajay Chauhan of  Parle \nBiscuits to provide job work to the Company.  However, \nthere was no positive response even from Parle Biscuits.  \n   The reason for closing down the manufacturing \nactivities is there is no job work which can be done in \nthe said factory.  As stated in the closure application the \ncompany for last 32 years was doing only the job work \nfor Britannia Industries Ltd.  And the efforts mentioned \nhereinabove will support the contention of the company \nthat there is no other way out but to close its \nmanufacturing operation.  \n \nFor Harinagar Sugar Mills Ltd.  \n(Biscuit Division)  \n            Sd/- \nAuthorised Signatory)”   \n \n(Emphasis supplied)  \n \n \n3.7  The authorities once again found the response \nlacking.  Vide letter dated 4th November 2019 said that their \nearlier resp onse did not, once again , cover all aspects, i.e., \nthe possibility of the employees'  absorption into other \nmanufacturing divisions and also the possibility of HSML CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 12 of 44 \n moving to the production of other goods , apart from \nbiscuits. They were once again asked  to resubmit their \napplication.  \n3.8  On 22nd November 2019 HSML , in their response , \ncontented that by virtue of Section 25 -O(3) of the Act , the \npermission of closure is deemed to have been granted, and \nthe authorities have now become functus officio . The \nworkers ’ unions also opposed the closure, registering  the \nsame vide letter dated 4th November 2019 . They cited \n‘ulterior motives’ and lack of bona fide  reasons.  \n3.9  The Deputy Commissioner, Labour, sent to HSML \ntwo letters, dated 20th and 22nd of November 2019 asking \nthem to be present for a meeting on 26th November 2019, \nand conveying  to them that the State Government was yet to \ngrant permission for closure and as such, they should not \nclose down the business on 27th November 2019, \nrespectively.  \n3.10  Workers’ unions on the same day as their letter also \napproached the Industrial Tribunal  seeking to restrain \nHSML from going forward with the closure. An ad -interim \norder came to be passed by the Tribunal , granting said relief.  \n3.11  These letters dated 4th November 2019, 20th \nNovember 2019 and 22nd November 2019 were the subject \nmatter of challenge before the High Court .  CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 13 of 44 \n THE IMPUGNED JUDGMENT  \n \n4.  The proceedings before the High Court, the culmination of \nwhich was the judgment  impugned in these appeals, were as \nfollows: - \n4.1 Order dated 28th November 2019 records the statement \nof Mr. Ravi Kadam, Senior Counsel appearing for \nHSML that the salaries for the month of November \nshall be p aid without insisting that the employees \nattend work. It is also recorded therein that the \nemployees shall maintain peace and harmony.  \n4.2 On the next date , i.e.,  12th December 2019  it was \ndirected that the salaries for December be paid on or \nbefore 6th January 2020.  \n4.3  Arguments were heard and concluded on 7th February \n2023.  \n4.4 The finding s in the impugned judgment can b e \nsummarised thus  : \n            Firstly, the Court discussed the scheme of Section \n25-O of the Act and found tha t an application for closure ha s \nto be made to a competent authority at least 90 days prior to \nthe date from which the closure is sought to be made \neffective; the reasons for such closure must be clearly stated; \non receipt of such application, the ‘appropriate \nGovernment’ is to make an enquiry ; provide an opportunity CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 14 of 44 \n for hearing all concerned  - workmen, employer and persons \ninterested in closure, and then pass a reasoned order, also \nkeeping in view interests of the general public.  Section      \n25-O(3) provides that if such an appropriate authority fails \nto communicate an order made thereby, granting or denying \npermission within 90 days of the application being \npreferred, it shall be deemed that the permission was granted \nat the expiry of 60 days. Other parts of Section 25 of the Act \nwere also taken note of such as the p ower of review, the \nremaining in force of the order of the competent authority \nfor a period of one year etc.  \n         Secondly, it was observed that the case of the \npetitioners (appellants before us) was that orders had not \nbeen passed by the competent authority within the \nstatutorily prescribed time frame, and consequently, the \ndeeming fiction provided for in the Act would come into \nforce and permission of closure would be deemed granted \nupon the expiry of 60 days from the application, since more \nthan 90 days had passed since such making of application. \nThe stand of the State was also taken into account  - which \nwas that the communi cation dated 25th September 2019 \nconstituted an order refusing the grant of requisite \npermission. It would be appropriate to extract the CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 15 of 44 \n consideration made by the High Court, of these contrasting \nsubmissions. It is as follows  : \n \n“24.  The first objection of Mr. Naidu is that even if \ncommunications dated 25 September 2019 were to be \nassumed as decisions, the decisions are not taken by the \nauthority, viz. Hon’ble Minister for Labour but the same \nis taken by the Depute Secretary. To c ounter the \ncontention, the State Government has placed on record \nthe file noting on the basis of which the communications \ndated 25 September 2019 were issued. The file noting \nwould indicate that note was prepared by Desk Officer \non 30 August 2019 stating t hat as per notification dated \n25 June 2013, the powers under Section 25 -O (2) are \nconferred upon the Hon’ble Minister for Labour. It is \nfurther stated that the petitioners’ applications were \nrequired to be forwarded to the Hon’ble Minister for \nfurther acti on. However, there appears to be an \nendorsement in hand writing towards the end of the \nnoting to the effect that petitioners failed to furnish \ncomplete and cogent reasons in their applications. The \nnoting was approved by various officers in the hierarchy \nand finally came to be approved by Hon’ble Minister \nwith a remark accepting hand written endorsement with \nfurther direction that the establishment should be \nintimated to file application with cogent reasons. In \naccordance with the above decision of the Hon’ ble \nMinister, the letters dated 25 September 2019 were \naddressed to petitioners. We therefore repel the objection \nof the petitioners that the decision in communication was \nnot taken by the Hon’ble Minister. ” \n \n \n           Thirdly, the contention of HSML  that the application \ndated 28th August 2019 was complete in all respects and it \nought to have been treated as such was considered. It was \nsubmitted that the letter dated 10th October 2019 \n(reproduced supra) was in response to the authorities asking CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 16 of 44 \n them to resubmit .  They supplied thereby, additional reasons \nfor closure and the steps taken to prevent that eventuality. It \nwas held that since the undisputed position is that vide letter \ndated 10th October 2019 HSML sought to furnish additional \nreasons, that ipso facto would amount to an acceptance that \nthe application was not complete in all respects. That being \nthe case, the deeming fiction would not come into play. \nSince the application was deficient, the State Government \nneed not pass orders thereon.   It was thereafter held as \nunder:  \n \n“30.…The fact that authority was not convinced with the \napplication of the petitioner and had communicated that \ncogent reasons are not spelt out in the application would \nbe sufficient to conclude that the authority did not grant \nthe application for closure.  What was contemplated by \nletter dated 25 September 2019 was “re -submission” of \nthe application. Petitioners however chose to add reasons \nto the pending applications on 10 October 2019. \nPetitioners failed to submit fresh applications by \nproviding statemen t of reasons as directed by State \nGovernment vide letters dated 25 September 2019. This \nis the reason why the State Government was once again \nrequired to convey to petitioners that they were required \nto resubmit the applications by subsequent \ncommunication s dated 4 November 2019. It is only after \nreceipt of letters dated 4 November 2019 petitioners took \na stand of deemed permission under Section 25 -O(3) of \nthe ID Act in their letters dated 22 November 2019.  \n \n31. We are therefore unable to accept the contention \nraised on behalf of the petitioners that the closure \napplications filed by them on 28 August 2019 were \ncomplete in all respects so as to trigger deemed \npermission under provisions of Section 25  O(3) on CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 17 of 44 \n expiration of period of 60 days. Petitioners themselves \naccepted the position that the closure applications were \nincomplete by seeking to adduce reasons for closure by \nletters dated 10 October 2019. It therefore cannot be held \nthat the establishments of th e petitioners are deemed to \nhave been closed on expiration of period of 60 days from \nthe date of submission of closure applications dated 28 \nAugust 2019. ” \n \nThe Writ petitions were dismissed.  \n \nSUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES  \n \n5.  We have heard Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, lea rned Senior \nCounsel for the appellant  - HSML a s also the learned counsel \nappearing for the respondents.  \n \nA. Appellants  \n \ni. The impugned judgment is based on an erroneous \nreliance on the ‘wrong form’, which originated out \nof a submission of learned Counsel for the State. \nReliance  was place d by the learned Division Bench \non Form XXIV and instead , it should have \nconsidered Form XXIV -C.  \nii. The finding that the applications were incomplete is \nbased on a misunderstanding/misapplication of the \nforms.  \niii. Noting in the internal office file cannot be used to \nconstrue what constitutes an order. Reference is CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 18 of 44 \n made to Bachhittar Singh v. State of Punjab6; Sethi \nAuto Services Station v. DDA7; and Shanti Sports \nClub v. Union of India8 to submit that the internal \nfile noting does not constitute an order. \nFurthermore, even such a contention that the letter \ndated 25th September 2019 is based on such noting \nis belied , for it does not say so.   Instead , it only asks \nfor details of the efforts made to avoid closure.  \niv. An application for c losure can only be disposed of \nby an orde r in accordance with Section 25 -O(2). If \nit is not so done, what h as been pro vided for in \nSection 25 -O(3) wi ll kick in.  \nv. The previous iteration of Section 25 -O was struck \ndown by this Court vide its judgment in Excel Wear \nv. Union of India9 on the ground that it did not \nprescribe a time limit for deciding the applications \nfor closure. It was found that the restrictions were \nnot in accordance with Article 19(6) of the \nConstitution of India. The amended iteration was \nupheld vide judgment in Orissa Textile and Steel v. \n \n6 AIR 1963 SC 395  \n7 2009 (1) SCC 180 \n8 (2009) 15 SCC 705  \n9 (1978) 4 SCC 224  CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 19 of 44 \n State of Orissa10, wherein it was held that the \nrequirement to conduct an enquiry , give a hearing, \npass a reasoned order , and also the time limit  was \nthe curing of defects present in the previous version \nof the section. It has been so submitted by the \nappellants to show that the 60-day requirement is \nmandatory. If not so observed, it would violate \nArticle 19(1)(g).  \nvi. It has not been shown by the respondents, h ow the \napplications made by the appellants are \ndefective/incomplete. Providing of further \ninformation cannot mean that the original \napplication was defective. The decision in State of \nHaryana v. Hitkari Potteries11 was relied upon to \nshow that even when the application was belatedly \nrejected on the ground that it was incomplete in  \ncertain respects, this Court held the deemed \npermission to be granted.  \nvii. The 60-day time period provided for in the Act \ncannot be extended, including on the pretext of \nresubmission of the application for closure. There \nwere two letters issued by the State authority, one \n \n10 (2002) 2 SCC 578  \n11 (2001) 10 SCC 74  CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 20 of 44 \n on 25th September 2019 and the other on 4th \nNovember 2019, with the latter one being beyond \nthe said time period. Thereafter were two further \nletters dated 20th and 22nd November 2019  directing \ntheir presence for a meeting , both clearly beyond  the \ntime limit. Further , it is said that there is no \nprovision for resubmission . Permitting the same \nwould unsettle the scheme of the law.   \nviii. The Labour Minister is the “appropriate \nGovernment” within the meaning of the Act, hence \nall action s contemplated under Section 25 -O could \nhave been undertaken by him only. N o further \ndelegation thereof is  provided for or permissible \nwithout notification to such effect under Section 39 \nof the Act. Be that as it may, it has been held in \nOrissa Textile and Steel (supra)  that sub -delegation \nof quasi  judicial function is impermissible. No \ncommunication has been addressed by the \n‘appropriate Government’ within the time frame.  \nix. The letter dated 25th September 2019 is by no means \nan order.  Had it been so, there was no basis for the \nState’s further letters.  In fact, letter dated 4th \nNovember 2019 makes reference to the application \nfor closure dated 28th August 2019.   Said letter was CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 21 of 44 \n also not marked to the workmen/their \nrepresentatives which is a requirement under \nSection 25 -O(2).  \nB. Respondents  \n \nThe Workers Union, namely the Maharashtra Rajya \nRashtriya Kamgar Sangh (INTUC) has filed written \nsubmissions. Their stand is that t he impugned judgment is \njustified and takes the correct interpretation of facts and \nlaw.  It has been argued  therein, inter alia , that : \ni. The first response of the State to the closure \napplication, i.e., letter dated 25th September 2019 is \nnot within the sphere of challenge.  \nii. The communication which took place regarding the \nalleged closure of HSML and Sha ngrila12 total \napproximately 300 workers, and non -inclusion of \ntheir recognised union in such discussions is \nabsolutely detrimental to the interests of these \nworkers.  \niii. The intent of Section 25 -O is to protect the \nfundamental rights of the employees , i.e., \nlivelihood. The stand of the State is in consonance \n \n12 Appellants in the connected SLP  CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 22 of 44 \n therewith, keeping in view important factors such as \ngenuineness and adequacy of reasons.  \niv. No question of law arises in the present matter \nwhich requires or would justify, the interference of \nthis Court under its jurisdiction under Article 136 of \nthe Constitution of India.  \nv. The deeming provision under Section 25 -O(3) of \nthe Act has to be read in continuation with Section \n25-O(1) thereof. Since the employees were never \ninformed of the enquiry as contemplated under  \nSection 25 -O(2) of the Act and the same never took \nplace, closure cannot  be deemed to have  been \ngranted thereunder.  \nvi. The incompleteness of the applications was \naccepted by the appellants themselves since they \nproduced additional reasons. Also, the argument of \nrespondent No.1 that i nternal noting of the file being \nused to show that the file had not been delayed, has \nbeen adopted by the Respondent -Union.  \nvii. Since the learned Industrial Tribunal had granted \nstay on 26th November 2019, and the writ petition \nsubject matter of these appeals , was filed before the \nHigh Court on the same day, there has been no \neffective order of closure thus far.  CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 23 of 44 \n viii. The question of Respondent -State as to whether the \nworkers could be accommodated in other ongoing  \nconcerns under the control of the HSML – was \njustified. None of the monetary proposals have been \naccepted by the workers as placed before the Court \nand so, they are entitled to full benefits of Section \n25-O(6) of the Act.  \nix. In furtherance of their submissions, reliance is \nplaced on a judgment of the High Court of \nJudicature at Madras in Sree Meenakshi Textile \nMills Ltd. v. Madurai Textile Workers Union \n(CITU) & Ors.13 \n \nQUESTIONS  TO BE CONSIDERED  \n \n6.  Having heard the learned  counsel at length and captured \ntheir submissions as above, the following questions would fall \nfor our consideration  : \nA. Whether letter dated 25th September 2019 can be \nconstrued to be an order  - Connectedly, whether the \nappellants would be entitled to the relief of deemed \nclosure, as on 27th October 2019 by virtue of the deeming \nfiction present in Section 25 -O(3) of the Act?  \n \n13 1979 (38) FLR 213  CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 24 of 44 \n B. What would be the meaning of the phrase ‘appropriate \nGovernment’ and whether in the facts of this case, it was \nthe appropriate Government acting in the matter of the \nclosure  - if not what is the effect in law, thereof?  \n \nANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION   \n \n7.  At the outset , two aspects must be taken note of. One  is \nthat the Constitution of India under Article  19 provides for the \nfreedom of trade, profession, occupation and business. Meaning \nthereby that all citizens of the country have freedom to choose a \nlocation of their choice and run it as they deem  it fit, subject to \nthe reasonable restrictions that may be made by the legislature. \nWhen it comes to industry which is covered under Article 19, the \nfield of the statute is occupied by the Industrial Disputes Act , \n1947 . As such, its scope m ust be set out.  \n \nFirst  \nIn Cooverjee B. Bharucha v. Excise Commr .14, a Bench \nof five learned Judges , while dismissing an application under \narticle 32 of the Constitution of India arising from the grant of \nlicense to sell country liquor to a person, allegedly in \ncontravention of the Rules set out for such purpose , i.e., in a \n \n14 (1954) 1 SCC 18  CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 25 of 44 \n manner , which according to the petitioner , violated his right \nunder Article 19(1)(g), held  : \n \n“7.   Article 19(1)( g) of the Constitution guarantees that \nall citizens have the right to practise any profession or to \ncarry on any occupation or trade or business, and sub -\nsection (6) of the Article authorises legislation which \nimposes reasonable restrictions on this right in the \ninterests of the general public. It was not disputed that in \norder to determine the reasonableness of the restriction \nregard must be had to the nature of the busi ness and the \nconditions prevailing in that trade. It is obvious that these \nfactors must differ from trade to trade and no hard -and-\nfast rules concerning all trades can be laid down. It can \nalso not be denied that the State has the power to prohibit \ntrades which are illegal or immoral or injurious to the \nhealth and welfare of the public. Laws prohibiting trades \nin noxious or dangerous goods or trafficking in women \ncannot be held to be illegal as enacting a prohibition and \nnot a mere regulation. The nature of  the business is, \ntherefore, an important element in deciding the \nreasonableness of the restrictions. The right of every \ncitizen to pursue any lawful trade or business is \nobviously subject to such reasonable conditions as may \nbe deemed by the governing aut hority of the country \nessential to the safety, health, peace, order and morals of \nthe community …”  \n \n \n \n  \nSecond  \nA Constitution B ench of this Court in  Hindustan \nAntibiotics Ltd. v. Workmen15 held as below  noting the object of \nindustrial law  :  \n \n \n15 1966 SCC OnLine SC 106  CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 26 of 44 \n “9. At the outset, it will be convenient to consider the \nquestion of principle. The object of the industrial law is two -\nfold, namely, ( i) to improve the service conditions of \nindustrial labour so as to provide for them the ordinary \namenities of life, and ( ii) by that process, to bring about \nindustrial peace which would in its turn accelerate \nproductive activity of the country resulting in its prosperity. \nThe prosperity of the country, in its turn, helps to improve \nthe conditions of labour. ”  \n \n \n  This Court in Ajaib Singh v. Sirhind Coop. Marketing -\ncum-Processing Service Society Ltd.16, in the paragraphs \nextracted below, discuss es the intent of the legislation and its \nhistory, in the following terms  : \n \n“5.  ...The Act is intended not only to make provision for \ninvestigation and settlement of industrial disputes but also to \nserve industrial peace so that it may result in more \nproduction and improve the national economy. In the present \nsocio -political economic syst em, it is intended to achieve \ncooperation between the capital and labour which has been \ndeemed to be essential for maintenance of increased \nproduction and industrial peace. The Act provides to ensure \nfair terms to workmen and to prevent disputes between th e \nemployer and the employees so that the large interests of the \npublic may not suffer. The provisions of the Act have to be \ninterpreted in a manner which advances the object of the \nlegislature contemplated in the Statement of Objects and \nReasons. While int erpreting different provisions of the Act, \nattempt should be made to avoid industrial unrest, secure \nindustrial peace and to provide machinery to secure the end. \nConciliation is the most important and desirable way to \nsecure that end. In dealing with indus trial disputes, the courts \nhave always emphasized the doctrine of social justice, which \nis founded on the basic ideal of socio -economic equality as \nenshrined in the Preamble of our Constitution. While \nconstruing the provisions of the Act, the courts have t o give \n \n16 (1999) 6 SCC 82  CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 27 of 44 \n them a construction which should help in achieving the \nobject of the Act.  \n \n6. The history of the legislation with respect to the industrial \ndisputes would show that for the first time in the year 1920 \nthe Trade Disputes Act was enacted which provided for \ncourts of enquiry and Conciliation Boards and forbade \nstrikes in public utilit y service without a statutory notice in \nwriting. The Act did not make provision for any machinery \nfor settling of industrial disputes. The said Act was repealed \nand replaced by the Trade Disputes Act, 1929 which started \nthe State intervention in the settle ment of industrial disputes \nand armed the Government with the power which could be \nused whenever considered fit to intervene in industrial \ndisputes. This Act was amended in the year 1938 authorising \nthe Central and Provincial Governments to appoint \nConcili ation Officers for mediating in or promoting the \nsettlement of industrial disputes. Shortly thereafter the \nGovernment of India promulgated the Defence of India \nRules to meet the exigency created by the Second World \nWar. Rule 81 -A gave powers to the Governm ent to intervene \nin industrial disputes and was intended to provide speedy \nremedies for industrial disputes by referring them \ncompulsorily to conciliation or adjudication by making the \nawards legally binding on the parties and by prohibiting \nstrikes or loc kouts during the pendency of the conciliation or \nadjudication proceedings. The Industrial Employment \n(Standing Orders) Act, 1946 was enacted which made \nprovision for framing and certifying of standing orders \ncovering various aspects of service conditions i n the \nindustry. The Industrial Disputes Bill was introduced in the \nCentral Legislative Assembly on 8 -10-1945 which \nembodied the essential principles of Rule 81 -A of the \nDefence of India Rules and also certain provisions of the \nTrade Disputes Act, 1929 conc erning industrial disputes. \nThe Bill was passed by the Assembly in March 1947 and \nbecame the law w.e.f. 1 -4-1947. The present Act was \nenacted with the objects as referred to hereinabove and \nprovided machinery and forum for the investigation of \nindustrial d isputes, their settlement for purposes analogous \nand incidental thereto. The emergence of the concept of a \nwelfare State implies an end to the exploitation of workmen CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 28 of 44 \n and as a corollary to that collective bargaining came into its \nown. The legislature had intended to protect workmen \nagainst victimisation and exploitation by the employer and \nto ensure termination of industrial disputes in a peaceful \nmanner. The object of the Act, therefore, is to give succour \nto weaker sections of society which is a prerequisite for a \nwelfare State. To ensure industrial peace and pre -empt \nindustrial tension, the Act further aims at enhancing the \nindustrial production which is acknowledged to be the \nlifeblood of a developing society. The Act provides a \nmachinery for investigation and settlement of industrial \ndisputes ignoring the legal technicalities with a view to avoid \ndelays, by specially authorised courts which are not \nsupposed to deny t he relief on account of the procedural \nwrangles. The Act contemplates realistic and effective \nnegotiations, conciliation and adjudication as per the need of \nsociety keeping in view the fast -changing social norms of a \ndeveloping country like India. It appea rs to us that the High \nCourt has adopted a casual approach in deciding the matter \napparently ignoring the purpose, aim and object of the Act. ” \n \n8.  Since both the questions that arise for our consideration \nare intertwined, they shall be taken up together. The instant \ndispute pertains to the closure of HSML and Shangrila, industrial \nunits engaged in manufacturing  for BIL.  Section 25 -O of the Act \ndeals with this situation. The extract as it relates to the dispute \nherein , reads  : \n \n “[25-O. Procedure for closing down an undertaking. — \n(1) An employer who intends to close down an undertaking \nof an industrial establishment to which this Chapter applies \nshall, in the prescribed manner, apply, for prior permission at \nleast ninety days before the date on which the intended \nclosure is to beco me effective, to the appropriate \nGovernment, stating clearly the reasons for the intended \nclosure of the undertaking and a copy of such application \nshall also be served simultaneously on the representatives of CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 29 of 44 \n the workmen in the prescribed manner: Provided that nothing \nin this sub -section shall apply to an undertaking set up for the \nconstruction of buildings, bridges, roads, canals, dams or for \nother construction work.  \n \n(2) Where an application for permission has been made under \nsub-section (1), the appropriate Government, after making \nsuch enquiry as it thinks fit and after giving a reasonable \nopportunity of being heard to the employer, the workmen and \nthe persons intere sted in such closure may, having regard to \nthe genuineness and adequacy of the reasons stated by the \nemployer, the interests of the general public and all other \nrelevant factors, by order and for reasons to be recorded in \nwriting, grant or refused to grant  such permission and a copy \nof such order shall be communicated to the employer and the \nworkmen.  \n \n(3) Where an application has been made under sub -section (1) \nand the appropriate Government does not communicate the \norder granting or refusing to grant permission to the employer \nwithin a period of sixty days from the date on which such \napplication is made, the permission applied for shall be \ndeemed to have been granted on the expiration of the said \nperiod of sixty days.  \n…” \n \n9.  Sub-section 1 states that an employer who wants to close \ndown his business concern must, write to the concerned \n‘appropriate Government’ - \n(a) at least 90 days before the date of intended closure;  \n(b) stating reasons for such closure;  \n(c) undertaking that the copy of this application has been \nserved on the representatives of the workmen . \n \n          As per sub -section (2) , the appropriate is  to, \n(a) Making a suitable enquiry;  CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 30 of 44 \n (b) After providing a reasonable opportunity of hearing to \nthe employer, the workmen and  those interested in the \nclosure of such business;  \n(c) And considering the genuineness, adequacy of reasons, \ninterests of the general public & all other relevant factors;  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nby an order in writing, recording reasons, grant or refuse \nsuch permission.  Such an order is to be communicated to \nthe employer and the workmen.  \n        Sub-section (3) deems the grant of permission for closure  as \nrequested  if the appropriate Government  does not, within sixty \ndays of the application, make an order .  \n10.  If there exists the freedom to set up and run a \ntrade/business as one sees fit, necessarily, there has to be a set of \nrights vesting with the proprietor/owner to take decisions as may \nbe in his best interest.  At the same time, it is true that the law \ndoes not permit such owner or proprietor to take any and all \ndecisions without having considered and accounted for the \nimpact that it shall have on the employees or workers that are part \nof this establishment. This  is evidenced by the provision \nextracted above providing for a detailed procedure to be followed \nwhen a person wishes to ‘shut shop’, but concomitant providing \nthat if the concerned Government does not take action with \nreasonable expediency, the business o wner should not be saddled \nwith the costs and responsibilities of running the business CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 31 of 44 \n indefinitely, till such time the authority arrives at a proper and \njust decision. The sum and substance are that Article 19(1)( g) \nincludes the right to shut down a business but is , of course, \nsubject to reasonable restrictions.  This interplay of Article \n19(1)(g) and Section 25 -O of the Act engaged in the attention of \na Constitution Bench of this Court in Excel Wear  (supra) , when \nit was cast with considering the constitutionality of Section  25-O \nas it then stood. It has subsequently been amended, challenged \nbefore this Court and upheld in Orissa Textile and Steel (supra) , \nwhich we will discuss further ahead.  \n11.  In Excel Wear  (supra), N.L Untwalia , J., writing for the \nCourt made some pertinent observations which we see fit to \nreproduce with profit  :  \n \n“20… But then, as pointed out by this Court in  Hatisingh \ncase the right to close down a business is an integral part \nof the right to carry it on. It is not quite correct to say that \na right to close down a business can be equated or placed \nat par as high as the right not to start and carry on a \nbusiness at all.  The extreme proposition urged on behalf \nof the employers by equating the two rights and placing \nthem at par is not quite apposite and sound. Equally so, \nor rather, more emphatically we do reject the extreme \ncontention put forward on behalf of the Labour U nions  \nthat right to close down a business is not an integral part \nof the right to carry on a business, but it is a right \nappurtenant to the ownership of the property or that it is \nnot a fundamental right at all. It is wrong to say that an \nemployer has no right to close down a business once he \nstarts it. If he has such a right, as obviously he has, it \ncannot but be a fundamental right embedded in the right \nto carry on any business guaranteed under Article \n19(1)( g) of the Constitution. ” CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 32 of 44 \n 12.  A Constitution Bench in Orissa Textiles  (supra) through \nVariava J., observed as follows about the current iteration of \nSection 25 -O : \n \n“18. We also see no substance in the contention that the \namended section merely deals with the procedural \ndefects pointed out in  Excel Wear case [(1978) 4 SCC \n224 : 1978 SCC (L&S) 509 : (1979) 1 SCR 1009] and \ndoes not deal with the substantive grounds set out \nin Excel Wear case  [(1978) 4 SCC 224 : 1978 SCC \n(L&S) 509 : (1979) 1 SCR 1009] . In our view the \namended Section 25 -O is very different from Section 25 -\nO (as it then stood). It is now more akin to Section 25 -N \n(as it then stood) the constitutional validity of which was \nupheld in  Meenakshi Mills case  [(1992) 3 SCC 336 :  \n1992 SCC (L&S) 679] . In  Excel Wear case  [(1978) 4 \nSCC 224 : 1978 SCC ( L&S) 509 : (1979) 1 SCR 1009] \nit has been accepted that reasonable restrictions could be \nplaced under Article 19(6) of the Constitution.  Excel \nWear case  [(1978) 4 SCC 224 : 1978 SCC (L&S) 509 : \n(1979) 1 SCR 1009] recognizes that in the interest of \ngeneral public it is possible to restrict, for a limited \nperiod of time, the right to close down the business . The \namended Section 25 -O lays down guidelines which are \nto be followed by the appropriate government in granting \nor refusing permission to close down. It  has to have \nregard to the genuineness and adequacy of the reasons \nstated by the employer. However, merely because the \nreasons are genuine and adequate cannot mean that \npermission to close must necessarily be granted. There \ncould be cases where the interes t of general public may \nrequire that no closure takes place. Undoubtedly where \nthe reasons are genuine and adequate the interest of the \ngeneral public must be of a compelling or overriding \nnature.  Thus, by way of examples, if an industry is \nengaged in manu facturing of items required for defence \nof the country, then even though the reasons may be \ngenuine and adequate it may become necessary, in the \ninterest of the general public, not to allow closure for \nsome time. Similarly, if the establishment is CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 33 of 44 \n manufacturing vaccines or drugs for an epidemic which \nis prevalent at that particular point of time, interest of the \ngeneral public may require not to allow closure for a \nparticular period of time. We must also take a note of \nsub-section (7) of the amended  Section 25 -O which \nprovides that if there are exceptional circumstances or \naccident in the undertaking or death of the employer or \nthe like, the appropriate government could direct that \nprovision of sub -section (1) would not apply to such an \nundertaking. This, in our view, makes it clear that the \namended Section 25 -O recognizes that if there are \nexceptional circumstances then there could be no \ncompulsion to continue to run the business.  It must \nhowever be clarified that this Court is not laying down \nthat some difficulty or financial hardship in running the \nestablishment would be sufficient . The employer must \nshow that it has become impossible to continue to run \nthe establishment.  Looked at from this point of view, in \nour view, the restrictions imposed are reasonable and in \nthe interest of the general public. ” \n \n(Emphasis supplied)  \n \n13.  What can be deduced regarding the scope of section 25 -O \nfrom the above extract is – \ni. the right to close the business is subject to the interest \nof the general public;  \nii. any application seeking permission for closure must \ndisclose adequate and genuine reasons which the \nauthority has to have regard for ; \niii. in certain cases , however , even if the reasons are \ngenuine and adequate, it does not mean that permission \nto close ought to be granted;  \niv. if it is found that the reasons are general ly adequate, \nand despite that the appropriate Government decides CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 34 of 44 \n for refusal of permission of foreclosure , then the \ninterest of the general public involved in that particular \ncase must be “compelling” and “overriding”;  \nv. financial difficulty on its own cannot constitute the \nreason for shutting down the business. An employer \nmust demonstrate exceptional circumstances or an \nimpossibility of running the business.  \n14.   In the instant facts, the application for closure was  duly \naddressed to the authority, which was acknowledged to be on 28 \nAugust 2019. The Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Labour \nGovernment of Maharashtra , responded on 25 September 2019 \nstating that no sufficient reasons had been provided for closure. \nThe letter read - “it will be possible to take action only if you can \nsubmit the application again by providing explanation regarding \nother efforts initiated by you for not closing down the Division, \nprovidi ng justifiable as well as consummate rationale for this \naction.”  Hereby, it was informed that action could not be taken \non the application as it stood  and that they would have to resubmit \nwith better particulars.  \n15. It is contended by HSML that the Deputy Secretary made \nsuch an order without the requisite authority since he was not the \n“appropriate Government” to deal with applications under \nsection 25 -O. As such, the order to revise and resubmit would be \nnon-est in law.  It is an undisputed position, as also noted by the CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 35 of 44 \n High Court, that the powers under section 25 -O rest with the \nMinister.  There is no difficulty in that respect. The State \nGovernment , being the appropriate Government , has delegated \nits power specifically to the Minister for Labour. Section 39 of \nthe Act provides for such a situation.  It reads  : \n \n“39. Delegation of powers. - The appropriate \nGovernment may, by notification in the Official Gazette, \ndirect that any power exercisable by it under this Act or \nrules made thereunder shall, in relation to such matters \nand subject to such conditions, if any, as may be \nspecified in the direction, be exercisable also, -- \n (a) where the appropriate Government is Central \nGovernment, by such officer or authority subordinate to \nthe Central Government or by the State Government, or \nby such officer or authority subordinate to the State \nGovernment, as may be specified in the noti fication; and  \n(b) where the appropriate Government is a State \nGovernment by such officer or authority subordinate to \nthe State Government as may be specified in the \nnotification. ” \n \nThere is nothing on record to show that the Deputy \nSecretary has been duly authorised to conduct communication \nand/or accept or reject applications for closure made by industrial \nunits. The concerned authority in that regard is only the Minister.  \nIf it is considered that the Minister for Labour himself represents \nthe State Government or is merely an agent of the State \nGovernment, then for the Deputy Secretary to act, there ought to \nhave been a notification in that respect. Otherwise, if the Minist er \nfor Lab our is a delegate of the State Government, then there has \nto be a notification therefor as well. According to the impugned CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 36 of 44 \n judgment , a notification to this effect dated 25 June 2013 is \npresent . However, the same is not on record. The Respondent -\nState has contended that the internal noting placed on record \nbefore the High Court shows that the file had travelled up to the \nMinister, and , therefore, any action consequent to such approval \nby the Minister is in accordance with the law. \n16.  We find it difficult to accept this contention  for two  \nreasons. There is no express authority resting with the Deputy \nSecretary. This we have already observed. Second, reliance \ncannot be placed on internal noting to establish compliance with \nprocedure . This Court in  Pimpri Chinchwad New Township \nDevelopment Authority v. Vishnudev Coop. Housing Society17, \nin a case pertaining to proceedings under the Land Acquisition \nAct, 1894 concerning the issue of whether the State is at liberty \nto withdraw from an acquisition,  held “ …a mere noting in the \nofficial files of the Government while dealing with any matter \npertaining to any person is essentially an internal matter of the \nGovernment and carries with it no legal sanctity;…” .  [Also see \nBachhittar Singh  (supra) ; Sethi Auto Services Station (supra) ; \nand Shanti Sports Club  (supra)] .  \nHypothetically, assuming t hat the letter dated 25 \nSeptember 2019 was sent to HSML with the approval of the \nMinister, as  allegedly  shown by the internal noting in the office \n \n17 (2018) 8 SCC 215  CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 37 of 44 \n file, and was thereby issued by the competent authority , even  in \nthat case, we find the ‘order’ to be lacking. The order accepting \nor rejecting an application for closure is undoubtedly an \nadministrative order.  It is noted that the fi le originated from the \ndesk officer and travelled up through the desks of various \nauthorities and made its way to the Minister. One of these \nauthorities, it is unclear which one made the noting that the \nclosure application did not disclose cogent reasons. T he Minister \nendorsed this finding and noted in the file that they should be \nasked to submit the application afresh. This is tried to be shown \nas a decision of the Minister. For the competent authority to take \na decision, as the law understands it, there has to be ‘application \nof mind’. The question that needs to be addressed is whether \nendorsement of  a noting made by a subordinate officer can be \n‘application of mind’ . To show the same, it is generally prudent \nthat reasons are recorded.  In decades past, there was a belief that \nthe Government would be brought to a standstill if it had to \nprovide reasons for each administrative action , keeping in view \nthe fact that it functions through a myriad of agencies and \nauthorities18.  Even here, it was stated that when such a decision \naffects the rights of parties, reasons should be accorded.  It may \nbe observed here that Section 25 -O specifically provides “by \norder and for reasons to be recorded in writing,”  and so, reasons \n \n18 Mahabir Jute Mills Ltd. v. Shibban  Lal Saxena, (1975) 2 SCC 818  CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 38 of 44 \n are a statutory necessity .  With time, it is now settled that \nadministrative authorities are also required to give reasons for a \ndecision made.   In Star Enterprises v. City and Industrial \nDevelopment Corpn. of Maharashtra Ltd.19,  a three -Judge \nBench in the context of tenders invited by a corporation which is \n‘State’ within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of \nIndia, held as follows in regard to  giving reasons for its decisions:  \n \n“10. In recent times, judicial review of administrative \naction has become expansive and is becoming wider day \nby day. The traditional limitations have been vanishing \nand the sphere of judicial scrutiny is being expanded. \nState activity too is becoming fast perv asive. As the State \nhas descended into the commercial field and giant public \nsector undertakings have grown up, the stake of the \npublic exchequer is also large justifying larger social \naudit, judicial control and review by opening of the \npublic gaze; these  necessitate recording of reasons for \nexecutive actions including cases of rejection of highest \noffers. That very often involves large stakes and \navailability of reasons for actions on the record assures \ncredibility to the action; disciplines public conduc t and \nimproves the culture of accountability. Looking for \nreasons in support of such action provides an opportunity \nfor an objective review in appropriate cases both by the \nadministrative superior and by the judicial process.  The \nsubmission of Mr . Dwivedi,  therefore, commends itself \nto our acceptance, namely, that  when highest offers of \nthe type in question are rejected reasons sufficient to \nindicate the stand of the appropriate   authority  should be \nmade available and  ordinarily the same should be \ncommunicated to the concerned parties unless there be \nany specific justification not to do so.”  \n \n(Emphasis Supplied)  \n \n19 (1990) 3 SCC 280  CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 39 of 44 \n Reasons, therefore, are important and ought to be recorded. \nIt could be said that the conclusion reached by the office of the \nMinister that HSML had not supplied sufficient reasons for \nclosure would itself be sufficient to qualify as ‘reasons’. \nHowever, ca n an endorsement of the view taken by an \nundisclosed officer of the Ministry be said to be an ‘application \nof mind’ by the competent authority when the Minister is the sole \nauthority?  We think not. The decision had to  be Top Down and \nnot otherwise. Had it been that this conclusion of insufficiency of \nreasons was the Minister’s conclusion , and then they would have \ndirected the Deputy Secretary to communicate the decision to \nHSML, then our conclusion may have been different.  \n17.  Given  the above discussion, the necessary conclusion is \nthat the letter dated 25 September 2019 addressed by the Deputy \nSecretary to HSML cannot be constituted to be an order since \nsuch order to resubmit the application was without any authority \nsince it was no t the appropriate Government acting in that regard  \nand not an order rejecting or accepting the application . The same \nconclusion can be reached on a second count  - the ‘order’ \nsuffered from the vice of non -application of mind by the \ncompetent auth ority.   \n18.  Section 25 -O provides that the appropriate Government \nmay, after making an enquiry and hearing all the concerned \nparties , pass an order in writing accepting or rejecting the CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 40 of 44 \n application for closure. It also provides that if the appropriate \nGovernment does not communicate and order within 60 days of \nthe date of application, there shall be deemed closure. We have \nheld that the appropriate Government had not acted in respect of \nthe application made by HSML  since the Minister, who was the \ncompetent authority, had not applied his mind to the \nadministrative ‘order’ nor, did the Deputy Secretary have the \nauthority to do so . In other words , the appropriate Government \nfailed to make an d communicate any order on the application for \nclosure .  The deemed closure would, therefore, come into effect.  \n19.  Separately, we may observe that the reasoning furnished \nby the Deputy Secretary to reject the application f or closure made \nby HSML is insufficient , and it appears to have been given for \nthe sole purpose of rejecting the application without due \napplication of mind. As discussed supra, an employer seeking to \nclose his business must show compelling and overriding \ncircumstances.  The application for closure clearly states, as \nalready reproduced supra that “Thus BIL has terminated the job \nwork agreement with the Biscuit Division and the said provision \nhas no other manufacturing avenue, since the said Division was \nmanufacturing biscuits only for BIL. In view of the above, the \nbiscuit division has no alternati ve but to close down, the \nmanufacturing activities. ”. We may add HSMC  to have clarified \nthat since inception no job wor k for anyone else was ever done CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 41 of 44 \n and that now there is no further scope of executing work for \nanyone else.  We are quite certain that this spells impossibility.   It \nis not the case of the Respondent -State that the statement made \nby HSML is incorrect and that they had other opportunities \nongoing and available, and despite the same, they had sought \npermission for closure. Then, we ask ourselves, when there is no \noppo rtunity or avenue for production, what shall the employees \ndo? \n20.  Arguendo,  if we keep aside the 60-day time period for the \ndeemed closure to take effect , we find that in the subsequent letter \ndated 10 October 2019, the position stands further clarified that \nfor the last 32 years,  HSML undertook work only from BIL  and \nin doing so, the raw material and necessary plant and machinery \nwere provided by the latter itself . Upon receipt of the notice of \nclosure, in an attempt to save the division, they tried to persuade \nBIL to re consider  its decision but were not met with success. \nThey subsequently  approached other companies seeking \nmanufacturing work, but to no a vail. In the attending facts and \ncircumstances, we hold that the re did indeed exist sufficient \ncompelling circumstances  for closure . \n21. The High Court, in our considered view, erred in placing \nreliance on Form XXIV -B, instead of XXIV -C which, resulted \ninto an erroneous appreciation of statutory provisions.  \n CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 42 of 44 \n CONCLUSION  \n \n \n22.  In that view of the matter, we hold that application dated \n28th August 2019 was complete in all respects , and the 60 -day \nperiod for the deemed closure to take effect would be calculable \nfrom said date. Second, the Deputy Secretary was not the \nappropriate Government who could have asked HSML to revise \nand resubmit the application for closure. That authority is only \nvested  with the Minister  concerned . The Minister did not, even \nin the slightest, consider the merits of the matter independently , \nmuch less with or without any application of mind. Sub-\ndelegation  to the officer was not permitted by law, and, therefor e, \nany communication made by him would be without any legal \nsanction.  \n23.  The appeal s are allowed. It is, however, clarified that the \nmoney paid to the employees by orders of the High Court in the \npendency of the writ petitions would not be recoverable from \nthem. At this juncture, we may refer to the order made by this \nCourt preserving the matter for judgment .  It was recorded therein \nas follows  : \n \n“O R D E R  \n… \n \n5. Shri Rohatgi,  learned senior counsel, on \ninstructions, states that a sum of Rs.4 Crores \n(approximately) already stands deposited. In CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 43 of 44 \n addition, a further sum of Rs.10 crores can be paid by \nthe petitioner to the respondent workmen. He clarifies \nthat the said amount would be in addition to the \namount of gratuity (approximately Rs.4 crores) which \nthe workmen are otherwise entitled to.  \n 6. The entire sum, i.e., the amount of gratuity plus the \nenhanced amount can be distributed as compensation \namongst the workmen who may be eligible and \nentitled to, for being on the rolls of the company.  \n7. This, of course, is by way of an endeavour to put \nan end to the controversy and without prejudice to the \nrespective rights and contentions of the parties. ”  \n \n \n24.  Considering that some of the employees may be, with the \nclosure of this concern, losing the only job they have known and \nstill others would be, for no fault of their own, rendered \nunemployed, we appreciate the gesture made by HSML. Such a \nstatement is take n on record.  At the close of the hearing,            \nMr. Mukul Rohtagi, learned Senior Counsel had left the issue of \nfurther enhancement of the amount to the Court.  Having given \nthoughtful  consideration, we deem it just and proper to further \nenhanci ng th e appellants’ offer by a sum of Rs.5 crores, t hus, \nmaking it Rs.15 Crores instead of Rs.10 Crores, as mentioned  in \nour order extracted supr a.  Let the amount be released forthwith , \nas per their entitlement,  in favour of the employees and, in any \ncase, not later than eight  weeks from the date of the judgment . \n \n \n CA@SLP(C) 4268 of 2023 etc.                                              Page 44 of 44 \n  \nPending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of . \n \n \n \n \n……… ........... …………………….J.  \n(SANJAY KAROL)       \n \n \n \n \n…………………………………….J.  \n(PRASHANT KUMAR MISHRA)                    \n4th June, 2025;  \nNew Delhi."
