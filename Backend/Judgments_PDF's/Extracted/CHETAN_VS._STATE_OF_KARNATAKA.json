The present appeal has been preferred against the judgment  \nand order dated 06.12.2010 passed by the Division Bench of the High \nCourt of Karnataka, Circuit Bench at Dharwad in the Criminal \nAppeal No. 666 of 2007 , whereby the High Court upheld the \nconviction and sentence imposed upon the present appellant under \nSections 302 and 304 of the IPC  and for offences under Sections 3 \nand 5 punishable under Sections 25 and 27 of Arms Act ,1959 by  \nPage 2 of 76 \n  \njudgment  dated 28/29.03.2007 passed by the F.T.C. -II & Addl. \nSessions Judge, Belgaum in Sessions Trial No 267 of 2006.  \n \n2. The conviction is based on circumstantial evidence relying o n \nthe last seen theory supported by the recovery of articles including \nthe weapon of crime and forensic evidence and the act of \nabscondence by the appellant.  \n \n3.  As the appellant is seeking reversal of the concurrent findings \nby the two courts below, the Sessions Court and the High Court, this \nCourt has to tread very cautiously , as observed by this Court on \nnumerous occasions including in Mekala Sivaiah v. State of Andhra \nPradesh, (2022) 8 SCC 253 , wherein it has been held that unless the \nfindings are perverse and rendered in ignorance of material evidence, \nthis Court should be slow in interfering with concurring findings. It \nwas thus observed  by this Court  in Mekala Sivaiah  (supra) in the \nfollowing words:  \n \n“15. It is well settled by judicial pronouncement that Article \n136 is worded in wide terms and powers conferred under the \nsaid Article are not hedged by any technical hurdles. This \noverriding and exceptional power is, however, to be \nexercised sparingly and  only in furtherance of cause of \njustice. Thus, when the judgment under appeal has resulted \nin grave miscarriage of justice by some misapprehension or \nmisreading of evidence or by ignoring material evidence then  \nPage 3 of 76 \n  \nthis Court is not only empowered but is well expected to \ninterfere to promote the cause of justice.  \n16. It is not the practice of this Court to re -appreciate the \nevidence for the purpose of examining whether the findings \nof fact concurrently arrived at by the trial court and the High \nCourt are correct or not. It is only in rare and exceptional \ncases where there is some manifest illegality or grave and \nserious miscarriage of justice on account of misreading or \nignoring material evidence, that this Court would interfere \nwith such finding of fact.”  \n \n4.  Keeping the aforesaid cautionary approach in mind, this Court \nwould proceed to examine the appeal at hand by considering whether \nthere is manifest error or illegality in the impugned judgment and \nwhether any grave and serious miscarriage of justice on acc ount of \nmisreading or ignoring material evidence has occurred in the present \ncase. This would invariably require a proper examination of the facts \nand context of the case, for which we must revisit the background \nfacts of the case and the evidence adduc ed, considered by the Trial \nCourt as well as the High Court.  \n \n \n5.  FACTUAL MATRIX OF THE CASE : \n \n5.1 The Prosecution case in brief is that the appellant and the \ndeceased Vikram Sinde were friends. About eight months prior to the \nincident which occurred on 10.07.2006, the appellant had borrowed  \na sum of Rs.  4000 /- (Rupees Four Thousand only)  from  one Ravind ra  \nPage 4 of 76 \n  \nChavan (PW19) , in order to lend the same in turn to the decease d, \nwhich however , was n ot returned by the deceased to the appellant \neven after a lapse of about 7 -8 months , despite repeated demands to \nreturn  the same . In that connection, there was an argument between \nthe appellant and the deceased in which the deceased had apparently \ninsulted  the appellant , because of which the appellant bore a grudge \nagainst the deceased.  \n5.2 It is further the case of the Prosecution that the appellant on \n10.07.2006 at about 20.30 hours after taking a 12 Bore D.B.B.L  Gun \nwith cartridges belonging to his grandfather on the pretext of going \nfor hunting , took the deceased along with him on his Hero Honda \nmotorcycle to the sugarcane grove  located in Shah apur village , which \nbelong ed to the complainant , namely , Arun Kumar Minache (PW1) . \nIt has been alleged that at about 22 .00 hours on the same night , the \nappellant shot the deceased  dead with the said D.B.B.L  gun and thus, \ncommitted the offence under Section 302  of the  IPC.  \n5.3 It was further alleged that after committing the said offence , \nhe took the Nokia mobile phone and gold chain belonging to the \ndeceased and misappropriated the same , thus committ ing the offence \nunder Section 404  of the  IPC.         \nPage 5 of 76 \n  \nAccording to the Prosecution,  since the appellant carried and \nused the D.B.B.L  gun belonging to his grandfather without a valid \nlicense , he committed the offence under Section 3 read with Section \n25 of the Arms Act.  The appellant was also charged with committing \nan offence  punishable under Section 5 read with Section 27 of the \nArms Act .  \n5.4 As per the Prosecution, as  the deceased  did not return after he \nleft home at around 7.45 PM of 10.07.20 06, the father of the deceased \ntelephoned the house of the appellant but was informed that he was \nnot at home. He then went to the ho use of the appellant early morning \nnext day  on 11.07.2006  and enquired from him about the \nwhereabouts of his son, to which the appellant gave false information \nthat he had  parted ways with  the deceased at about 8.00 PM the \nprevious evening .  The father of the deceased also received a call \nfrom one Chandrakant Shinde informing him that the deceased had \ngone to Pune and would return within two days .  Thereafter , the \nfather of the deceased started searching for his missing son and file d \na missing report.  \n5.5 It is the case of the Prosecution that  on 13.07.2006 the dead \nbody of the deceased was found in the sugarcane field belonging to \nArun Kumar  Minache (PW -1), who informed  the police  about the  \nPage 6 of 76 \n  \ndiscovery of the body.  However, since the dead body was \ndecomposed , his identity could not be ascertained.   Upon recovery of \nthe dead body , a police case was registered at Kagawa d Police \nStation , and necessary message s were flash ed to other police stations  \nto seek information about  the identity  of the deceased . Thereafter , an \ninvestigation was launched and an inquest was held . The post -\nmortem  examination of the dead body was  also conducted  on \n13.07.2006 . Since the identity of the dead body could not be \nascertained , the discovery of the dead body was published in the \nnewspaper which was noticed by the father on 14.07.2006 and then \nhe went to Kagawad Police Station and identified the dead body  \nthrough photographs, handkerchief , motorcycle key found in the pant \npocket , and sweater  on the dead body .  \n5.6 In the course of the investigation , it was revealed that the \nappellant and the deceased were last seen together near Mahishyal \nbus stand and thereafter  seen on a motorcycle going towards \nShahapur , as noticed by one Ashok Shinde, the prosecution witness \n(PW-4), Ashok Jamadar  (PW-5) and Jamir Mulla (PW -3).  \n5.7 On the basis of the said information , the police arrested the \nappellant on 22.07.2006 at Miraj after making search  for him in \nseveral locations and was brought to Kagawad Police Station. During  \nPage 7 of 76 \n  \nthe investigation , the appellant confessed to the crime and \nvolunteered to produce the gun with which he committed the crime \nand also volunteered to show the place where he shot the deceased \nand the place where he sold the mobile phone belonging to the \ndeceased. The appellant also produced the gold chain , which  \npurported ly belong ed to the deceased which was seized by the \nInspector. Thereafter , the appellant led the police to the house of his \ngrandfather, Ram chandra rao Chavan  (PW-20), and produced  one 12 \nBore D.B.B.L  gun, two empty cartridges, one live cartridge, one \ntorch, Hero Honda motorcycle  and one empty handbag  which were  \nall seized . The appellant then led the police to the sugarcane field \nfrom where the left chappal of the deceased  was recovered .  He then \nled the Investigation Officer and the panchas near Bellanki Saravu \n(back water falls ) and showed the spot where he had shot the \ndeceased dead. Thereafter, the appellant led the police to Srigiri \nComplex at Dilukh Nagar, Hyderabad , where he pointed out an \nelectronic shop  of S. Samba Shivakumar ( PW-25) to whom  he had \nsold the mobile phone . According to the Prosecution, the shop -owner  \nidentif ied the appellant and admitted the transaction  and handed over \nthe mobile phone along with a xerox copy of the driving license  of  \nPage 8 of 76 \n  \nthe appellant , which was kept as proof of address given by the \nappellant to the shop keeper , which were  seized by the police.  \n5.8 During the trial the Prosecution sought to prove the case \nagainst the appellant  by examining as many as 31 witnesses and \nexhibited a number of documents and articles as mentioned  above . \nThe appellant took the plea of total denial . The appellant also did not \nlead any evidence  in his defence . \n5.9  The Trial Court , Fast Track Court II and Additional Sessions \nJudge, Belgaum , in Sessions Case No.267/2006  after hearing the \nProsecution and defence and on consider ation of the materials \nproduced before it , convicted the appellant under Section s 302 and \n404 of the IPC and Section s 3 and 5 punishable under Section 25 and \n27 of the Arms Act .        \nAccordingly , upon being  convicted under Section 302 of the \nIPC, the Court  sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for \nlife and to pay a fine of Rs.1000 /- and in default of payment , to \nundergo rigorous imprisonment for six months.  \nThe appellant was also sentenced to undergo rigorous \nimprisonment for one year to pay a fine of Rs.1000/ - and in default  \nPage 9 of 76 \n  \nof payment of fine to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three \nmonths for the offence under Section 404 IPC.  \nFurther more , the appellant was sentenced to undergo rigorous \nimprisonment for one year and to pay a fine of Rs.500/ -(Rupees five \nhundred) and in default of payment of fine, to undergo rigorous \nimprisonment for three months for contravention of Section 3 \npunishable under Section 25 of the Arms Act.  \nThe a ppellant was also sentenced to undergo rigorous \nimprisonment for three years and to pay a fine of Rs. 1000/ - (Rupees \none thousand) and in default of payment of fine to undergo rigorous  \nimprisonment  for three months for contravention of Section 5 \npunishable under Section 27 of the Arms Act.   \nAll these sentences were directed to run concurrently.  \n5.10 Being aggrieved by the conviction by the Additional Sessions \nJudge , Belgaum, as above , the appellant preferred an appeal before \nthe Karnataka High Court Circle Bench at Dharwad by filing \nCriminal Appeal No.  666/2007. The said appeal was dismissed by the \nimpugned  order dated 06.12.2010 , against  which the appellant has \npreferred this appeal before us.   \nPage 10 of 76 \n  \nSince the conviction by the Trial Court was affirmed by the \nHigh Court , it may be appropriate first to examine the basis on which \nthe Trial Court convicted the appellant and how  it was  upheld by the \nHigh Court  upheld it .  \n \n6. CONSIDERATION BY THE TRIAL COURT : \n \n6.1 As can be seen from the narration of the incident by the \nProsecution, the case is based on circumstantial evidence , as no \neyewitness  had seen  the shooting of the deceased by the appellant \nwith a  gun, which led to his death.  \nAs we embark upon the exercise to scrutinize  the correctness \nof the conviction based on circumstantial evidence, we may recollect \nthe five golden  principles of law governing trials  based on \ncircumstantial evidence , which this Court had dealt with from time \nto time , and succinctly explained in the celebrated  case of Sharad  \nBirdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra  (1984 ) 4 SCC 116 as \nfollows: - \n \n“152.  Before discussing the cases relied upon by the High \nCourt we would like to cite a few decisions on the nature, \ncharacter and essential proof required in a criminal case \nwhich rests on circumstantial evidence alone. The most \nfundamental and basic decision of this Court \nis Hanumant  v. State of Madhya Pradesh  [(1952) 2 SCC  \nPage 11 of 76 \n  \n71 : AIR 1952 SC 343 : 1952 SCR 1091 : 1953 Cri LJ \n129] . This case has been uniformly followed and applied \nby this Court in a large number of later decisions up -to-\ndate, for instance, the cases of  Tufail (Alias) \nSimmi  v. State of Uttar Pradesh  [(1969) 3 S CC 198 : 1970 \nSCC (Cri) 55] and  Ramgopal  v. State of \nMaharashtra  [(1972) 4 SCC 625 : AIR 1972 SC 656] . It \nmay be useful to extract what Mahajan, J. has laid down \nin Hanumant case  [(1952) 2 SCC 71 : AIR 1952 SC 343 : \n1952 SCR 1091 : 1953 Cri LJ 129] :  \n“It is well to remember that in cases where the \nevidence is of a circumstantial nature, the \ncircumstances from which the conclusion of guilt \nis to be drawn should in the first instance be fully \nestablished, and all the facts so established should \nbe consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt \nof the accused. Again, the circumstances should \nbe of a conclusive nature and tendency and they \nshould be such as to exclude every hypothesis but  \nthe one proposed to be proved. In other words, \nthere must be a chain of evidence so far complete \nas not to leave any reasonable ground for a \nconclusion consistent with the innocence of the \naccused and it must be such as to show that within \nall human proba bility the act must have been done \nby the accused.”  \n153. A close analysis of this decision would show that the \nfollowing conditions must be fulfilled before a case \nagainst an accused can be said to be fully established:  \n(1) the circumstances from which the conclusion \nof guilt is to be drawn should be fully established.  \nIt may be noted here that this Court \nindicated that the circumstances concerned “must \nor should” and not “may be” established. There \nis not only a grammatical but a legal distinction \nbetween “may be proved” and “must be or should \nbe proved” as was held by this Court in  Shivaji \nSahabrao Bobade  v. State of \nMaharashtra  [(1973) 2 SCC 793 : 1973 SCC (Cri) \n1033 : 1973 Crl LJ 1783] where the observations \nwere made: [SCC para 19, p. 807: SCC (Cri) p. \n1047]  \n“Certainly, it is a primary principle that \nthe accused  must  be and not \nmerely  may be guilty before a court can \nconvict and the mental distance between \n‘may be’ and ‘must be’ is long and divides \nvague conjectures from sure conclusions.”   \nPage 12 of 76 \n  \n(2) the facts so established should be consistent \nonly with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, \nthat is to say, they should not be explainable on \nany other hypothesis except that the accused is \nguilty,  \n(3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive   \nnature and tendency,  \n(4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis \nexcept the one to be proved, and  \n(5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete \nas not to leave any reasonable ground for the \nconclusion consistent with the innocence of the \naccused and must show that in all human \nprobability the act must have been done by the \naccused ”. \n \n  \n6.2 As can be seen from the  records, the  Trial Court formulated \nfive points for consideration which are reproduced as follows: - \n“1. Whether the prosecution has proved that on \n10.07.2006 at about 2200 hours the deceased had \ndied homicidal death due to gunshot  injury?  \n \n2. Whether the prosecution has proved that it is the \naccused  who has caused homicidal death of the \ndeceased by firing shot through D.B.B.L  gun \nmarked as MO.9.?  \n \n3. Whether the prosecution has proved that on the said \ndate, the a ccused  after causing the murder of \ndeceased Vikram Shinde, dishonestly mis -\nappropriate d or converted to his own use gold chain \nand mobile which were in possession of Vikram \nShine  at the time of death and thereby committed \nany offence punishable u/s 404 of IPC ? \n \n4. Whether the prosecution has proved that on the same \nday at about 2030 hours the a ccused  carried 12 bore \nBBL gun belonged to his grandfather  Ramachandra \nChavan, from his house to the land of compl ainant  \nPage 13 of 76 \n  \nArun Kumar and he was in possession of the said \ngun and cartridges without possessing required \nlicence and thereby contravened provisions of Sec.3 \nof Arms Act punishable u/s 25 of the Arms Act?  \n \n5. Whether the prosecution has proved that on the said \ndate at about 2200 hours in the land of Arun Kumar \ncompl ainant situated within Shahapur village limits \nthe accused  used 12 Bore DBBL  gun (MO.9) to \ncause death of the deceased Vikram Shine and \nthereby contravened the provisions of sec.5 \npunishable u/s 27 of the Arms Act? ” \n \n6.3 The Trial Court  consolidated all these issues together and \nconsidered the same in the light of the evidence adduced and held \nthat the Prosecution had proved their case.  \n6.4 While it may not be necessary to de al in detail at this stage of \nthe a nalysis of the evidence by the Trial Court, nevertheless , it would \nbe desirable to briefly refer to the findings of the Trial Court for better \nappreciation of the case.  \n6.5 Since the case revolves around circumstantial evidence, the \nTrial Court identified the following circumstances/ aspects  for \nconsideration :  \n(1)  Motive .  \n(2)  Homicidal death of the deceased by gunshot  injury .  \n(3)  The deceased was last seen in the company of the a ccused  \nin between 8 and 9.30 p.m . on 10.07.2006.    \nPage 14 of 76 \n  \n(4)  False information given by the accused  to the father of \ndeceased and his uncle .  \n(5)  Abscondence of the a ccused  from 11.07.06 till his arrest on \n22.07.06 .,  \n(6)  Extrajudicial confession on 12.07.06 before PW.18 by \ngoing over to the room of his friend Yuvaraj Bennalkar \nsituate d at Dharwad .  \n(7)  Recovery of gold chain belonged to the deceased from the \npossession of the accused  after his arrest on 22.07.0 6 and \nrecovery of Nokia mobile belong ing to the deceased from \nPW.25 at the instance of  the a ccused .  \n(8)  Recovery of the DBBL  gun, 2 spent cartridge cases , one \nlive cartridge, Eveready battery and star gutka empty \nhandbag  from the house of PW -20, Ramachandra Chavan , \nthe grandfather of the accused at the instance of the \naccused .  \n(9)  Discovery of the place of murder and recovery of left foot \nchappal of the deceased from sugarcane field situate d near \nthe place where the dead body was found at the instance of \nthe accused .  \n(10) Discovery of fact i.e.  where mobile sim card was thrown at \nthe instance of the a ccused .  \n \n6.6 As regards the motive that impelled the appellant to commit \nthe crime, the Prosecution case is that since the deceased fail ed to \nreturn Rs.4000/ - which was lent by the appellant  and was also \ninsulted by the deceased , the appellant bore a grudge against the \ndeceased and, as revenge , killed the deceased.  \nAs regards this issue of motive , the Trial Court , on \nconsideration of the evidence on record , concluded  that the monetary  \nPage 15 of 76 \n  \ntransaction, which was the basis for constituting  the motive for \ncommitting the crime , was not fully established.  \nThe Trial Court , however , was of the view that the Prosecution \ncase cannot be thrown out merely because the motive could not be \nestablished .  \n6.7 The Trial Court conclude d based on the evidence that the death \nof the deceased was not accidental or suicidal but homicidal .  \n6.8 To link the appellant with the said homicidal death , the Trial \nCourt relied on the last -seen theory , for which the Trial Court referred \nto the evidence of a number  of witnesses , including  the brother of the \ndeceased, Digvijay Shinde  (PW-12), who had seen the appellant and \nthe deceased near Mahishyal bus stand  in the evening of the incident,  \nwhich was also noticed  by another witness , Anil (PW-11), a friend of \nPW-12.   \nThe Trial Court also relied on the evidence of another  witness , \nnamely Jamir Mulla (PW -3), who deposed that when he was standing \nby the side of the road, he saw the deceased  riding on the pillion of a \nmotorcycle .   \nThe Trial Court also considered the evidence of Ashok Shinde \n(PW-4) who was an autorickshaw driver who testified to have seen  \nPage 16 of 76 \n  \nthe deceased and appellant together at about 5.45 PM on the fateful \nday when he was standing near Karamveer Vidyalaya High School \nground.   \nThe evidence of another  witness , namely Ashok Jamadar (PW -\n5) was also relied upon , who, while he was returning to Mahishyal \nand standing near the Kag awad Circle, saw the deceased and the \nappellant on a motorcycle going towards Shiraguppi at  around 9.15 \nPM on 10.07.2006 . The said witness , PW-5, after coming to know \nabout the death of Vikram Shinde , went to Kag awad Police Station \nand identified  the body . Though PW -5 was declared hostile by the \nProsecution as he resiled from his previous statement on other \naspects of the incident ,  the  Trial Court held that the versions of PW-\n12, PW-11, and PW-5 regarding the deceased and the appellant being \nlast seen together cannot be disbelieved.  \n6.9 The Trial Court,  thereafter , consider ed the other circumstance \nthat the appellant had given false information to his uncle and his \nfriend Devaraj Sutar (PW -14), which , according to the Trial Court \nproved his guilty mind.    \nPage 17 of 76 \n  \n6.10 The Trial Court held that another  incriminating circumstance  \nwas the abscondence of the appellant  from 11.07.2006 till he was \narrested on 22.07.2006  at Miraj .  \n6.11 The Trial Court , thereafter , took into consideration the \nextrajudicial confession alleg edly made by the appellant on \n12.07.2006 in the room of  one Yuvara j Bennalkar in Dha rwad where  \nthe witness namely Sandip Sandalage (PW -18) was staying . The \nappellant apparently made  the extrajudicial confession  to the said \nwitness , PW-18, that he took the deceased on 10.07.2006 on the \npretext of going for hunting and killed him by shooting him with the \ngun as the deceased d id not re pay the loan of Rs.  4000/ - and insulted \nhim when he demanded the money.  \n6.12  The Trial Court also considered the other incriminating \ncircumstance s, i.e., recovery of gold chain belonging to the deceased \nfrom the possession  of the appellan t, recovery of Nokia mobile phone \nbelonging to the accused, recovery of D.B.B.L  gun, 2 spent and 1 live \ncartridges case, Everready battery and Star Gutka empty  handbag  \nfrom the residence of his grandfather where the appellant was \nstaying , left foot chappal of the deceased from the sugarcane field \nand discovery of the place  of murder at the instance of the appellant .   \nPage 18 of 76 \n  \nThe Trial Court , accordingly , held based on  said evidence \nadduced  that the aforesaid circumstances /facts have been proved.  \n6.13   However, the Trial Court held that the Prosecution was not able \nto prove the motive,  and the extrajudicial confession said to have \nbeen made by the appellant. Nevertheless, in the light of the other \ncircumstances that, according to the Trial Court were proved , despite \nnoticing  certain irregularities and lapses in the course of the \ninvestigation , which according  to the  Trial Court w ere not material \nnor could be fatal to the prosecution case  and by holding  that \nirregularities in the investigation would not entitle the accused to be \nacquitted , held that the charges under Section s 302 and 404 of the \nIPC, Section 3 and 5 of the Arms Act punishable under Section 25 \nand 27 Arms Act  have been proved  and proceeded to convict that the \nappellant as above.  \n \n7. CONSIDERATION BY THE HIGH COURT  \n \n7.1  The High Court not iced that of the 31 witnesses examined by \nthe Prosecution, sever al witnesses namely PW -1, PW -3, PW -5 to \nPW-9, PW -16, PW -18 to PW -20, PW -25 and PW -26 ha d turned \nhostile to the case of the Prosecution . Nevertheless , based on  the \ntestimony  of the other remaining  witnesses and other evidence , the  \nPage 19 of 76 \n  \nHigh Court held that the Prosecution ha d been able to prove the \ncharges against the appellant .  \n As regards the motive for the commission of the crime, though \nthe same was held not proved by the Trial Court, the High Court \nbased on  the evidence of PW -12 and PW -4 held that the Prosecution \nhad been able to prove the motive for the commission of the crime.  \n7.2 The High Court held that the circumstance  of the last seen \ntogether of the appellant  with the deceased has been proved by the \nevidence of PW-4, PW -11 and PW -12.  \n7.3 The High Court consider ed the evidence of PW -14, (Devraj \nSutar) who was a friend and classmate of  the appellant who stated \nthat the appellant had contacted him on the phone on the day of  the \nincident and t old him that if his uncle  contact ed him, to inform  his \nuncle  that he (PW-14) is in Pune , though PW -14 was in Ahmednagar . \nThus, the  appellant sought to mislead his relatives about his \nwhereabouts .   \n7.4 As regards the seizure of the gun, the High Court held that the \nappellant had led the Police to the house of the grandfather and the \nsame was seized from his house. As per the evidence of the ballistic \nexpert    PW-30, it was proved that the said gun was functional and  \nPage 20 of 76 \n  \nhad shown discharge, which could not be explained either by the \nappellant or his grandfather -Ramachandra rao, PW -20, which would \ngo to prove that the gun seized had been used for shooting  the \ndeceased . The gunshot injuries , pellets and wads found in the skull \nof the deceased would show that the deceased had died due to \ngunshot injuries .  \n7.5 The High Court on consideration of the expert  witness N.G. \nPrabhakar  (PW-30), the Assistant Director of Forensic Science \nLaboratory, Bangalore , who examined the D.B.B.L  gun, cartridges , \npellets  and wads  found in the  skull of the  dead body , held that it was \nproved that the death of the deceased was caused by the gunshot fired \nfrom the said D.B.B.L  gun which was recovered  at the instance of  \nthe appellant.   \n7.6 The High Court also held that the Prosecution has been able to \nprove from the evidence of PW -31, Investigation Officer (IO) of the \nrecovery of the gold chain from the possession of the appellant \nimmediately on his arrest , and seizure of  the mobile phone at the \ninstance of the appellant in Hyderabad , which the same witness  \ncorroborated . These , according to the High Court  would show that \nthe appellant had secured possession  of the articles namely the gold  \nPage 21 of 76 \n  \nchain, mobile phone immediately after  the death of the deceased , \nwhich clearly incr iminates the appellant .  \n7.7   The High Court, based on the presented evidence, determined \nthat the appellant and the deceased were last seen together. As the \nappellant did not explain the whereabouts of the deceased on the \nnight of the incident, and in consideration of the recovery of the gun \nand cartridges as well as the recovery of the gold chain and Nokia \nmobile phone , the act of  abscondence, evasive  behaviour , post -\nmortem report, ballistic report, and the chain of circumstances, the \nHigh Court concluded that the incident in which the appellant killed \nthe deceased  was proven beyond reasonable doubt.  \nAccordingly,  the High Court dismissed the appeal.  \n8 SUBMISSION OF THE APPELLANT BEFORE US:  \n8.1 It was stren uously argued before us  by Mr. D.N. G oburdhun, \nlearned  Senior Counsel for  the appellant that the Prosecution had not \nbeen able to prove  that the appellant and appellant alone was \nresponsible for the death of the deceased as there was no eyewitness \nto the incident .   \nPage 22 of 76 \n  \nLd. Sr. Counsel points out that  no witness had spoken anything \nabout the appellant holding the gun when he was allegedly seen \ntogether with the deceased in the evening/night of the incident.  \n8.2  Even  the “last seen” incident on which the Prosecution \nhas heavily relied upon cannot be said to have been proved. \nAccording to L d. Sr. Counsel , the evidence of  the witnesses who had \nseen them  together is not credible. One of the witnesses , Digvijay \nShinde ( PW-12) was the younger brother of the deceased.  The other \nwitness PW -11 (Anil Babarao Bagat ) was a friend of PW -12, hence, \nthey were  interested  witnesses. Consequently , their  evidence cannot \nbe relied upon.  \nAs far as PW-4 (Ashok Shinde) , the auto  rickshaw  driver is \nconcerned , he is certainly a chance witness and as such , reliance \ncannot be place d on his evidence .   \nThis leaves two other witness es namely , Jamir Mulla ( PW-3) \nand Ashok Jamadar  (PW-5). \n PW-3 stated that he saw the deceased riding on the pillion  of \na motorcycle,  but he  did not see who was riding the motorcycle . \nThus,  this evidence cannot be invoked  to support the last seen theory  \nas the deceased was not seen with the appellant .   \nPage 23 of 76 \n  \nAs far as the other witness , namely PW -5 (Ashok Jamadar) is \nconcerned , he can  also be said to be a c hance witness , as he saw the \ndeceased and appellant together while he was standing  at Kagawad \nCircle .  \nAccordingly , learne d senior counsel appearing for the \nappellant has submitted that the fact of the appellant and the deceased \nbeing last seen together cannot be s aid to have been established with \ncogent evidence. Thus, if this circumstance is held to be not proved \nin accordance with law, nothing survives in the case , as no  one had \nseen the appellant shooting the deceased as alleged by the \nProsecution no r they were seen together in the field where the dead \nbody of the deceased was found.    \n8.3  It was submitted that the recovery of the mobile phone at the \ninstance of the appellant was not proved  as S. Samba Shivakumar , \nPW-25, the mobile shopkeeper , had categorically denied purchasing \nany mobile from the appellant .  \n8.4 It was also submitted that the D.B.B.L  gun was not seized at \nthe instance of the appellant and in  fact, it was the grandfather of the \nappellant who had produced the gun when the Police came to h is \nresidence .  According to the learned Senior Counsel one of the  \nPage 24 of 76 \n  \nseizure witnesses, V illas Macchendra Davari (PW -7), had \ncategorically denied that anything was recovered in his presence , \nthough he admitted  that the signature on the  seizure memo  was put \nas directed by the police . \n8.5    The learned senior counsel has submitted that the ballistic \nreport itself is doubtful .  Though it is the case of the Prosecution that \none live  cartridge was recovered from the house of the grandfather \nof the a ppellant, it was  not given  to the ballistic expert for his opinion , \nand as regards the two cartridges that were used for testing of the \ngun, it is not clear how these were purchased  and given to the ballistic  \nexpert. Thus, this important link in the prosecution ’s case cannot be \nsaid to have  been established.  \n8.6 Learned senior counsel also submits that since the \nProsecution ’s case is entirely based on the last seen theory , in absence \nof any motive for committing  the offence, which in the present case \nhas not been established, the foundation of the last seen theory \nbecomes  shaky.  \nLearned senior counsel  submits that even the Trial Court held \nthat the monetary transaction between the appellant and the deceased \nhad not been proved strictly. Thus,  the very basis of the case of the  \nPage 25 of 76 \n  \nProsecution that the appellant had killed the deceased to take revenge \nafter the deceased fail ed to repay the loan taken from the appellant  is \nabsent . Since  the motive ha d not been established , the Prosecution ’s \ncase based on circumstantial evidence  cannot stand .  \n8.7 It was also pleaded that it could not be proved conclusive ly \nthat the dead body recovered from the field was that of the deceased  \nas the dead body was in a highly decomposed  state.  \n8.8 Learned senior counsel for the appellant has also submitted \nthat there are so many  inconsisten cies and contradictions in the \nevidence of the prosecution witness es as had noted by the Trial Court \nand the High Court .  Yet, both the Courts  chose to ignore these \ninconsistenc ies and the contradictions and relied only on those parts \nof the evidence  that were favourable to the Prosecution to convict the \nappellant.  \n8.9 Accordingly , learned senior counsel for the appellant has \nsubmitted that since there are glaring gaps  in these circumstances , \nand there is no proper linkage, and these circumstances are also not \nproved beyond reasonable doubt, the prosecution ’s case based on \ncircumstantial evidence must fa il.   \nPage 26 of 76 \n  \nIt has been submitted that i t cannot be said that the Prosecution \nhas been able to prove that all circumstances are of such conclusive \nnature  and tendency which exclude every possible hypothesis except \nthat the appellant had caused the death of the deceased , and it cannot \nbe said that the chain of evidence establish ed in the present case  is so \ncomplete  that it  has not left any reasonable ground for the conclusion \nconsistent with the innocence of the appellant , and that in all \nprobability the act was committed by the appellant .  \n9. SUBMISSION OF THE STATE BEFORE US:  \n9.1 On the other hand, Ms. Eesha Bakshi,  learned counsel \nappearing for the State/Prosecution has contended that all  the \ncircumstances leading to the guilt of the appellant have  been proved \nwhich would only lead to the inference that  the appellant and \nappellant alone  was responsible for murdering the deceased .  \n9.2 Learned State Counsel submits  that the defence did not \nseriously dispute  the identity of the dead body and since PW -2, who \nwas the father of the deceased and PW -12, the brother of the deceased \nhad identified  the body  based  on the photograph , and the  dress worn \nby the deceased , there cannot be any doubt about the identity  of the  \nPage 27 of 76 \n  \ndead body. T he aforesaid evidence has been strengthened by the fact \nthat the motorcycle key was found in the pocket of the deceased.  \n9.3 It was also submitted  that the motive for  the commission of the \noffence ha d been duly proved as  it has been established that the \ndeceased had borrowed a sum of Rs.4000/ - (Rupees Four Thousand \nonly) from  the appellant regarding which a quarrel occurred between \nthem which was witnessed by PW-4, Ashok R Shin de.  \n9.4 It was also submitted that there were as many as five eye -\nwitnesses who had seen the appellant with the deceased the evening \nbefore his dead body was found three days later . The deceased was \nseen along with  the appellant around 9 pm of 10.07.2006 and he was \nfound missing as eviden ced by  the evidence of his father (PW -2), \nwho filed a missing report on 12.07.2006 .  The dead body was \nrecovered on 13.07.2006 and there is no evidence to show the \npresence of the deceased anywhere else during this intervening \nperiod , and as such , there cannot be any doubt that as the appellant \nwas last seen with the deceased , the onus was on the appellant to \nexplain the whereabouts of the deceased after they were seen last \ntogether which he failed to explain before the Court.  Therefore, the \nirresistible inference that can be drawn is that the appellant was \nresponsible for the deat h of the deceased.   \nPage 28 of 76 \n  \n9.5 Learned State Counsel further submit that it has come clearly \non record that the appellant had remained absconding during the \naforesaid period from 11.07.2006 to 22.0 7.2006 when the Police  \nultimately arrested him on 22.0 7.2006 in Miraj.  That abscondence \nand his attempt to mislead others  is clearly proved by the evidence of \nhis own friend and classmate Devraj Sutar (PW -14).  \nAccording to the learned State Counsel all the evidence  clearly \nshow s that the appellant was trying to mislead his relatives and others \nabout his whereabouts and trying to hide  which  is clearly indicati ve \nof the guilty mind of the appellant.  \n9.6 It has also been submitted that t he Prosecution , by relying  on \nthe opinion of the ballistic expert , has proved  that the gun produced \nbefore the Trial Court was used  for committing the crime . It has also \nbeen established that pellets and wads that were recovered from the \nskull cavity of the deceased  were part of 12 bore cartridge and these \ncould be fired from the gun , as per the ballistic expert, PW -30. Thus, \nthere cannot be any doubt that it  was the  appellant who had shot the \ndeceased dead with the D.B.B.L  gun.  \n \n  \nPage 29 of 76 \n  \n10. ANALYSIS AND FINDING BY THIS COURT  \n10.1  We have given our anxious consideration to the issues raised \nbefore us  and carefully examined the evidence on record .   \n10.2 As discussed above, the case revolves around the death of \nVikram Shinde, whose dead body was found in an agricultural field.  \nThe appellant is sought to be implicated in his death on the ground \nthat he was seen last together with the deceased  before the dead body  \nwas found three days later , and also because the deceased had \nsuffered gunshot injury on his head, which led to his death , and a \ndouble barrel gun was recovered at the instance of the appellant from \nthe house of his grandfather , with whom the appellant was staying. \nThe forensic evidence based on ballistic examination showed that the \ngun was in working condition and was used, and the pellets and wads \nfound in the brain and cavity of the skull of the deceased could be \nfired from the said gun .     \nSince, there was no direct evidence  on the death of Vikram \nShinde , the Prosecution case is entirely based on circumstantial \nevidence.    \nPage 30 of 76 \n  \n10.3 As the allegation is of commission of the offence of murder, \nthe first and foremost exercise to be undertaken is to ascertain \nwhether it was a case of suicide or accidental death or homicide .  \nThere does not appear to be not much of a controversy  that it \nwas a case of homicide .   \nThe fact that the deceased died an unnatural death due to \ngunshot injuries cannot be doubted in the light of the post -mortem \nand forensic evidence. The Medical Officer , PW-28, who conducted \nthe post -mortem had given his final opinion that the cause of death \nwas b allistic injuries to vital organ s. Though the post -mortem report \nitself was assailed by the appellant, in view of the other attending \nevidence of the panch witnesses  there can not be any shadow of doubt \nabout the unnatural death due to gunshot injury . Thus,  it was a clear \ncase of homicide.  \nGiven the nature of the gunshot injury received by the \ndeceased on his head and in the absence of recovery of any gun in \nthe hand of the deceased or near his body and since the gun shot was \nfired within a range of 3 ft from the muzzle of the weapon  and the \nexit of the gunshot wound was in the face,  a suicidal gunshot injury \ncan be safely ruled out.   \nPage 31 of 76 \n  \nThat i t was also not a case of accidental death  can be clearly \ninferred because of the absence of any evidence indicating so.   \n10.4  As we proceed further, it may be noted  that, in the present case, \nthough the appellant had made a feeble attempt to show that the dead \nbody that was recovered from the agricultural field was not that of \nVikram Shinde , who was missing , because of the evidence of  Ajitrao \nShinde , PW-2, the father of the deceased , and PW 12, Digvijay \nShinde, brother of the deceased , who had identified the dead body \nbased on the identification of the deceased 's sweater, pants and \nrecovery of the motorcycle key from the pants of the deceased , there \ncan be no  doubt about the identity of the dead body.  \n10.5   We will now deal with t he most crucial circumstance of last \nseen together , upon which much emphasis has been laid by both the \ncontesting parties in support of their rival contentions.  \n10.5.1  The last seen theory is based on the evidence of five \nwitnesses, namely, Jamir P. Mulla (PW -3), Ashok  R. Shinde (PW -4), \nAshok R. Jamadar (PW -5), Anil Bab arao Bagat (PW -11) and \nDigvijay Shinde (PW -12). \n10.5.2  PW-3, Jamir P. Mulla , claims to know both the appellant and \nthe deceased .  He  stated that on 10.07.2006 at about 8.30 pm when  \nPage 32 of 76 \n  \nhe was standing by the side of the road at Ambika Nagar, he saw the \ndeceased Vikram Shinde riding on the pillion of a motorcycle  and on \nseeing him he wished him . The motorcycle  went towards Narawad \nside.  However, he stated that he did not know who was riding the \nmotorcycle.  He also stated that he did not observe anything being \ncarried on the motorcycle.   \nIn view of the specific evidence that he did not see who was \nriding the motorcycle his evidence cannot independently be used to \nsupport the last seen theory  against  the appellant  unless propped by \nother evidence .  Though the said witness was declared hostile by the \nProsecution, in the cross -examination, this witness reiterates that he \nhad seen  the deceased  Vikram Shinde going on a motorcycle, and he \ncould later identify the dead body as that of Vikram Shinde from the \nclothe s he was wearing  when he saw him last . This evidence  is thus \nconsistent with the evidence of other witnesses who had seen the \ndeceased  Vikram  Shinde  going with the appellant on a motorcycle .  \n10.5.3     The other witness relied upon by the Prosecution is Ashok \nR. Shinde (PW -4), who was an auto rickshaw driver who kn ew both \nthe deceased and the appellant.  PW-4 stated that on 10.07.2006 at \nabout 5.45 -6.00 pm , when he was standing near Karamveer \nVidyalaya High School ground parking, both the appellant and  \nPage 33 of 76 \n  \ndeceased came near his auto rickshaw,  and he heard them discussing \ncertain money transaction , and the appellant was heard demanding \nreturn of certain amount from the deceased to which the deceased \ndenied having any knowledge.  He also heard the deceased abusing \nthe appellant as haramkhor  though the appellant did not react to it .  \nHe also stated that he heard them talking about hunting.  He stated \nthat as they were talking, passengers came and , thereafter did not give \nany further attention to their discussion.   \nThis evidence would show that the appellant and the deceased , \nwho were friends , were together shortly before they were seen \ntogether again later  riding a motorcycle  by Ashok R. Jamadar ( PW-\n5). This evidence  will also be relevant  to arguments between the two \nparties over some  money matters and their plans for  hunting.  \n10.5.4    Ashok R. Jamadar (PW -5) is the other witness th rough whom \nthe Prosecution seeks to establish the last seen theory. PW-5 knew \nboth the families of the appellant and the deceased.  He deposed that \non 10.07.2006, at about 9:15 pm, while he was standing at Kagawad \nCircle to proceed  to Mahishyal, he saw the appellant and the \ndeceased going  together on a motorcycle towards the Shiraguppi  \nside. On seeing them, he waved his hand. He also stated that the \ndeceased was carrying a bag and had spoken to him, but he did not  \nPage 34 of 76 \n  \ntalk to the appellant.  Thereafter, he came to Mahishyal. Later, on \n14.07.2006, he learnt about the murder of Vikram Shinde when \npeople were talking about him and thereafter, he went to the \nKagwada police station along with others  regarding the case .   \nAlthough he was declared a hostile witness as he resiled from \nhis previous statement made during the investigation, he reiterated \nduring  his cross -examination that the appellant was riding the \nmotorcycle and the deceased was with him on the motorcycle \nproceeding towards Shiraguppi.  Despite the witness being \nthoroughly cross -examined on behalf of the appellant, nothing could \nbe elicited from him to cast any doubt on his testimony as far as this \nvital evidence of the m being seen together last, before the dis covery \nof the dead body , is concerned.  \n In our opinion, if the said witness did  not fully  support the \nProsecution case and resiled from his previous statement given  \nduring investigation , nothing prevented  him resiling from the \nstatement that he saw the  appellant and the deceased together.  It may  \nbe noted that even though PW-5 was declared hostile , he reiterated \nin his cross examination that he saw the deceased and the appellant \ntogether. Thus , his evidence is trustworthy as regards this aspect.   \nPage 35 of 76 \n  \n10.5.5   The evidence of the aforesaid witness PW -5 has also been  \nsought to be impeached on the ground that he is a chance witness  and \nthus his evidence be ignored .  \nWe do not think that it can be ignored.  \nIt is for the reason that he kn ew both the appellant and the \ndeceased,  and nothing was shown that he was inimical to the \nappellant and more friendly to the deceased. He was not a stranger  \nsuddenly  emerging out of nowhere in the scene.  PW-5 had explained \nin his cross -examination as to  the  reason why he was present at the \nKagawad Circle  when he saw them together . He stated that he had \ngone to Kagawad to visit one of his relatives. While returning home , \nhe was passing through the said circle to catch  a bus to Mahishyal. \nHence, we see no reason to disbelieve his testimony.  \n10.5.6  Moreover, even if he is considered to be a chance witness who \nhappens to witness the appellant and the deceased together going on \na motorcycle by chance , yet the testimony cannot be ignored in the \nlight of the decision of this Court in Rajesh Yadav and Another v. \nState of Uttar Pradesh (2022) 12 SCC 200 wherein it was held as \nfollows: - \n “29. A chance witness is the one who happens to be at \nthe place of occurrence of an offence by chance, and  \nPage 36 of 76 \n  \ntherefore, not as a matter of course. In other words, he is \nnot expected to be in the said place. A person walking on \na street witnessing the commission of an offence can be a \nchance witness. Merely because a witness happens to see \nan occurrence by chance,  his testimony cannot be \neschewed though a little more scrutiny may be required \nat times. This again is an aspect which is to be looked \ninto in a given case by the court. We do not wish to \nreiterate the aforesaid position of law which has been \nclearly laid  down by this Court in  State of A.P .  v. K. \nSrinivasulu Reddy  [State of A.P .  v. K. Srinivasulu Reddy, \n(2003) 12 SCC 660 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 817] : (SCC pp. \n665-66, paras 12 -13) \n“12. Criticism was levelled against the evidence \nof PWs 4 and 9 who are independent witnesses by \nlabelling them as chance witnesses. The criticism \nabout PWs 4 and 9 being chance witnesses is also \nwithout any foundation. They have clearly \nexplained as to ho w they happened to be at the \nspot of occurrence and the trial court and the \nHigh Court have accepted the same.  \n13. Coming to the plea of the accused that PWs 4 \nand 9 were “chance witnesses” who have not \nexplained how they happened to be at the alleged \nplace of occurrence, it has to be noted that the \nsaid witnesses were independent witnesses. There \nwas not even a su ggestion to the witnesses that \nthey had any animosity towards any of the \naccused. In a murder trial by describing the \nindependent witnesses as “chance witnesses” it \ncannot be implied thereby that their evidence is \nsuspicious and their presence at the scene  \ndoubtful. Murders are not committed with \nprevious notice to witnesses; soliciting their \npresence. If murder is committed in a dwelling \nhouse, the inmates of the house are natural \nwitnesses. If murder is committed in a street, only \npassers -by will be witne sses. Their evidence \ncannot be brushed aside or viewed with suspicion \non the ground that they are mere “chance \nwitnesses”. The expression “chance witness” is \nborrowed from countries where every man's \nhome is considered his castle and everyone must \nhave an explanation for his presence elsewhere \nor in another man's castle. It is quite unsuitable \nan expression in a country where people are less \nformal and more casual, at any rate in the matter \nexplaining their presence.”   \nPage 37 of 76 \n  \n \n 10.5.7 PW-11 and PW -12 also saw the appellant and the \ndeceased together near the bus stand in the evening of 10.7.2006.  \nPW-12 is the brother of the deceased. According to him, his \ndeceased brother went out of the house after 7.45 PM in the evening \non a scooter. When PW -12 also went out to meet his friend, Anil \nBagat, PW -11 near the bus stand  that evening , he saw both the \ndeceased and the appellant coming together on the scooter at the bus \nstand, and his brother asked  him (PW-12) to take the scooter home \nby telling  him that he would come home later. His brother , however,  \ndid not return.  \nPW-11, a friend of PW -12, corroborates the aforesaid evidence \nof PW -12. PW-11 state d that he was acquainted with the appellant as \nhe was from  the village of  the appellant . PW -11 state d that he also \nknew the deceased. According to him when he was near Mahishyal \nBus Stand at about 8.00 PM on 10.07.2006, Digvijay, the brother of \nthe deceased , came there , and while they were talking, the appellant \nand the deceased c ame there on a scooter. Vikram Shin de (the \ndeceased)  then instructed  his brother , Digvijay  (PW-12), to take the \nscooter  home , informing  him that he would return later. He also heard  \nthe appellant saying that he would be going for hunting.      \nPage 38 of 76 \n  \nBased on the above evidence, both the Trial Court and the High \nCourt came to the conclusion that the deceased was last seen together \non 10.07.2006, before the dead body was discovered in the morning \nof 13.07.2006.  \n10.5.8     PW-11 states that he had acquaintance with the appellant as \nhe was from the same village. Hence, we see no reason to doubt his \ncredibility as he is unlikely to falsely testify against his own co -\nvillage r and he corroborates the evidence of PW -12, the brother of \nthe deceased.   \nAs far as PW -5 is concerned, though the defence had made \nstrenuous attempts to discredit him as he was earlier working for PW -\n2, the fat her of the deceased, nothing could be elicited to discredit his \ntestimony  as regards this fa ct of being last seen together .  \nWe are of the view that while the evidence of PW -5, PW -11 \nand PW -12 support s the last seen theory, the evidence of PW -3 and \nPW-4 strengthens this circumstance.  \n10.5.9      We have also noted that specific questions were asked from \nthese witness es that if they had seen the appellant and the deceased \ngoing together on the night of 10.07.2006 , why this information was  \nPage 39 of 76 \n  \nnot given to the father of the deceased, PW -2 earlier  before the dead \nbody was discovered on 13.07.2006 .  \nIt may be noted that even though the deceased may have been \nmissing since 1 0/11.07.2006, till the dead body was recovered and \nidentified , members of the public may not be concerned about the \nmissing of the deceased, unless the family members  specifically \nasked them of the deceased. It is only after the dead body was \nidentified  on 14.07.2006 and brought to public notice t hat witnesses \nwere  likely to come forward  to give information of any such relevant \nmaterial  and earlier sighting  of the deceased with the appellant . \nThere fore, non-informing  the family members of the deceased at an \nearlier point of time by the prosecution witness es who saw the \nappellant going in a motorcycle or seeing the appellant and deceased \ngoing together on a motorcycle on the night of 10.07.2006 cannot be \na ground  for disbeliev ing their testimony .  \nUnder the se circumstances , it cannot be said that the Trial \nCourt and High Court have committed a serious illegality in \nconcluding that the deceased and the appellant were  last seen \ntogether  or that the said finding was by ignoring material evidence  or \ncontrary to the evidence on record.    \nPage 40 of 76 \n  \n10.6   The next and most crucial consideration will be how the \nappellant could be linked to the death of the deceased.  \n10.6.1  In our opinion, the link is established based on the following \ncircumstances and established facts.  \n(i) The dead body of the deceased was recovered in a \ndecomposed state on 13.7.2006, three days after the \ndeceased was last seen  together with the appellant  on \n10.07.2006 . \n(ii)  As per the Medical Officer  who conducted the postmortem \non 13.07.2006, the death occurred 3 /4 days before  the \npostmortem  examination  which is consistent with the time \nthe deceased was seen last together with the appellant . \n(ii)   The dead body was discovered with gunshot wounds  on the \nhead . \n(iii)  A double barrel gun with 2 spent  and 1 live cartridges were  \nrecovered at the instance of the appellant.  \n(iv)  As per the opinion of the ballistic expert , \n  (a) The gun showed signs of discharge.  \n  (b) The gun was in working condition.  \n(c) Pellets  and wads were  recovered from th e brain/skull \nof the dead body,  and the se could  have been fired \nthrough the gun  examined . \n  (d) The double -barrel gun could be dismantled.  \n  \nPage 41 of 76 \n  \n10.6.2     The aforesaid facts are supported by the following \ncircumstances and acts of the appellant , which strengthens the \nlinkage.  \n (i) The appellant remained hidden from 11.07.2006 till \n22.07.2006. He was arrested on 22.07.2006 after extensive search on \nnumerous locations after the identification of the identity of the dead \nbody on 14.07.2006.   \n (ii) The appellant had misled his friends, his family members \nand that of the deceased.  \n (iii) Personal effect s of the deceased like gold chain was \nrecovered from the appellant.   \n   The aforesaid circumstances and acts are discussed in more \ndetail  as follows  : \n10.6.3  As regards the discovery of the dead body, PW1 , Arun Kumar \nMinache stated that on 13.7.2006, his workers had gone to the land \nto measure sugar cane crops. At 9:30 AM, one of his workers came \nto his house and informed him that a dead male body was lying in the \nsugarcane field. Thereafter, PW -1 went to t he sugar field and found \nthe dead body in a decomposed state.  The matter was reported to the \npolice on the same day.  \n It may be noted that while the deceased was found missing \nsince the night of 10.07.2006, and was subsequently found dead on  \nPage 42 of 76 \n  \n13.07.2006, the appellant was found missing from 11.07.2006 till the \npolice arrested him on 22.07.2006.   \n10.6.4       Though, the dead body was discovered after  three days of \nthe deceased went missing  on 13.07.2006, as per opinion of the \nforensic expert , the time of death of the deceased was between 3 to 4 \ndays prior to post -mortem examination on 13.07.2006, thus \nindicating that the deceased died soon after he went missing .   \n10.6.5   At this stage, it may be apposite to address a weighty \nargument advanced by Mr. Go burdhun, learned senior counsel for the \nappellant who contended that the last seen theory in the present case \nis not applicable for the simple reason that there is a long passage of \ntime between the appellant and the deceased last seen together and \nthe time when the dead body of the deceased was discovered.  \nThe deceased was last seen along with the appellant in the \nnight of 10.07.2006 and the dead body of the deceased was \ndiscovered on 13.07.2006 after a gap of three days.  \nLearned Senior Counsel submits that the time gap should be \nso small that the possibility of any other person being with the \ndeceased in the company of any other person should be ruled out. \nHence, because of this long gap of time, the last seen theory sought  \nPage 43 of 76 \n  \nto be invoked by the Prosecution loses its steam , giving rise to \nreasonable doubt as to whether the appellant was the real culprit or \nnot.  \n10.6.6   In this regard, the learned Senior Counsel has relied on \nthe decision of this Court in State of Goa v. Sanjay Thakran and \nAnr. (2007) 3 SCC 755 wherein this Court held that : - \n“31. Before we analyse the evidence of PW 11 Dinesh \nAdhikari, who was working as a domestic help in the bar \nand restaurant Iguana Miraj, PW 14 Calvert Gonsalves, \nwho was said to be in the company of A -1 and D -1 on the \nevening of 27 -2-1999 outside the lounge of  the restaurant \nand PW 6 Amit Banerjee, who was working as \nReceptionist of Hotel Seema, we would refer to certain \ndecisions of this Court on the point of “last seen \ntogether”. It is a settled rule of criminal jurisprudence \nthat suspicion, however grave , cannot be substituted for \nproof and the courts shall take utmost precaution in \nfinding an accused guilty only on the basis of \ncircumstantial evidence. This Court has applied the \nabovementioned general principle with reference to the \nprinciple of last see n together in  Bodhraj  v. State of \nJ&K  [(2002) 8 SCC 45 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 201] as under: \n(SCC p. 63, para 31)  \n“31. The last seen theory comes into play where \nthe time gap between the point of time when the \naccused and the deceased were seen last alive \nand when the deceased is found dead is so small \nthat possibility of any person other than the \naccused being the au thor of the crime becomes \nimpossible. It would be difficult in some cases to \npositively establish that the deceased was last \nseen with the accused when there is a long gap \nand possibility of other persons coming in \nbetween exists. In the absence of any oth er \npositive evidence to conclude that the accused \nand the deceased were last seen together, it would \nbe hazardous to come to a conclusion of guilt in \nthose cases.”   \nPage 44 of 76 \n  \n32. In Ramreddy Rajesh Khanna Reddy  [(2006) 10 SCC \n172 : (2006) 3 SCC (Cri) 512 : JT (2006) 4 SC 16] this \nCourt further opined that even in the cases where time \ngap between the point of time when the accused and the \ndeceased were last seen alive and when the deceased was \nfound dead is too small that possibility of any person \nother than the accused being the author of the crime \nbecomes impossible, the courts should look for some \ncorroboration.”  \n10.6.7     However, it may be noted that this Court also observed in \nthe aforesaid decision of Sanjay Thakran  (supra ) that it cannot be \nsaid in all cases that the evidence of last seen together is to be \nrejected merely  because the time gap is for a considerable long \nperiod, as stated in para 34 of the aforesaid decision which is \nreproduced herein as below:  \n“34. From the principle laid down by this Court, the \ncircumstance of last seen together would normally be \ntaken into consideration for finding the accused guilty of \nthe offence charged with when it is established by the \nprosecution that the time gap betwee n the point of time \nwhen the accused and the deceased were found together \nalive and when the deceased was found dead is so small \nthat possibility of any other person being with the \ndeceased could completely be ruled out. The time gap \nbetween the accused pe rsons seen in the company of the \ndeceased and the detection of the crime would be a \nmaterial consideration for appreciation of the evidence \nand placing reliance on it as a circumstance against the \naccused. But, in all cases, it cannot be said that the \nevidence of last seen together is to be rejected merely \nbecause the time gap between the accused persons and \nthe deceased last seen together and the crime coming to \nlight is after (sic  of) a considerable long d uration. There \ncan be no fixed or straitjacket for mula for the duration of \ntime gap in this regard  and it would depend upon the \nevidence led by the prosecution to remove the possibility \nof any other person meeting the deceased in the \nintervening period, that is to say, if the prosecution is \nable to lead such an evidence that likelihood of any \nperson ot her than the accused, being the author of the  \nPage 45 of 76 \n  \ncrime, becomes impossible, then the evidence of \ncircumstance of last seen together, although there is long \nduration of time, can be considered as one of the \ncircumstances in the chain of circumstances to prove the \nguilt against such accused persons. Hence,  if the \nprosecution proves that in the light of the facts and \ncircumstances of the case, there was no possibility of any \nother person meeting or approaching the deceased at the \nplace of incident or before the commission of the crime, \nin the intervening per iod, the proof of last seen together \nwould be relevant evidence. For instance, if it can be \ndemonstrated by showing that the accused persons were \nin exclusive possession of the place where the incident \noccurred or where they were last seen together with th e \ndeceased, and there was no possibility of any intrusion to \nthat place by any third party, then a relatively wider time \ngap would not affect the prosecution case.   \n               (emphasis added)  \n \n10.6.8  In the present case, as stated above, PW -28, Dr. S.V . \nHavinal, the Medical Officer  who conducted the post -mortem \nexamination on the dead body during his cross -examination stated \nthat it is not correct to say that the person might have died 5 days \nbefore the post -mortem examination . He stated that he might have \ndied 3 to 4 days before the post -mortem examination.  Thus, the \nProsecution case that the deceased was shot dead on the night of \n10.07.2006 before his dead body was discovered on 13.07.2006 does \nnot appear  to militate against the last seen theory in view of the \nmedical evidence that death occurred about 3/4 days prior .  Thus, it \ncannot be said that the time gap is for a considerable long period.   \nPage 46 of 76 \n  \n10.6. 9        The obvious inference the defence wanted to draw was that \nif death had occurred 5 days earlier, it would be earlier to 10.07.2006, \nwhich would have demolished the Prosecution case. Similarly, if the \ndeath had occurred about 2 days before the postmortem was  \nconducted, it would be after a few days of the missing of the deceased \non 10.07.2006 which would have cast a genuine doubt on the \nProsecution case because of time gap.  \n10.6.10 The forensic and ballistic opinion along with the \nsubsequent recovery of the gun, p ellets and wads and other object like \ngold chain fr om the appellant literally obliterates the doubtful \nelement which can be attributed to the gap in time and space of the \nlast seen together aspect of the circumstantial evidence. Had th is \nscientific evidence and subsequent recoveries not been available, \ncertainly, the time lapse between the fact of last seen together and the \ntime of death could have proved fatal to the  Prosecution case in the \npresent case.      \n Thus, this submission of the appellant that there was a long \ntime lapse, does not hold water.  \n10.6.11   It may be also noted that the place where the dead body \nof the deceased was discovered in a sugarcane field does not appear  \nPage 47 of 76 \n  \nto be visited by public  except for the workers who work in the field. \nIn fact, the dead body was discovered belatedly only by the workers \nof the owner of the sugarcane field, PW -1, Arun Kumar Maruti \nMinache.  \n10.6.12  PW-1 deposed that on 13.07.2006 his workers namely \nBismilla, Popat and Praveen had gone to the land for measuring \nsugarcane crop and at about 9.30 AM of the same day, Bismilla came \nto his house and inform ed him that the dead body of a male was lying \nnear Bellanki Saravu i.e., on the southern side of the land.   \nThus, by the very nature of the location and as evident from the \ntestimony of the owner of the land , it is quite apparent that the place \nwhere the dead body was found was not frequently visited because of \nwhich the dead body was discovered only on 13.07.2006  even though \nthe death occurred about 3 to 4 days ago as per the evidence of PW -\n28, the Medical Officer who conducted the post -mortem examination . \nHence, the possibility of the deceased being with another  person other \nthan the appellant before he was sho t is quite remote.  \n10.7    It is to be noted that it is not merely the discovery of the dead \nbody on 13.07.2006 after the deceased was last seen together with the \nappellant on 10.07.2006 that the Prosecution case is based. This last  \nPage 48 of 76 \n  \nseen theory is reinforced by the fact that the cause of death of the \ndeceased was gunshot injury and the weapon of crime was recovered \nat the instance of the appellant and there is forensic evidence in the \nform of pellets , and the wads found in the skull cavity of the deceased \nwhich could be fired from the said gun recovered  which links the \nappellant with the crime . \n In our opinion, given  the subsequent recovery of the gun and \nempty p ellets and forensic and ballistic evidence of a link between \nthe p ellets recovered from the body of the deceased and the gun \nrecovered, the time lapse which could have thrown doubt on the last \nseen theory pales into insignificance, rather it is rendered \ninconsequential.  \nThus,  the prosecution ’s case is not mere conjecture , but rather \nbased on established circumstances  and facts.  \n10.7.1      PW-28, the Medical Officer conducted the post -mortem \nexamination at the burial ground of S hiraguppi  on 13.07.2006  at 2:40 \nPM as the body was in early decomposition state , and the following \nexternal injuries  were found:  \n1) Circular shape d wound with diameter 1.5 cm, 3 cm,  \nabove the mastoid process in parietal bone.   \nPage 49 of 76 \n  \n2) Irregular shape wound in left infr aorbital region, \nmeasuring about 2 x 3 cm.   There was no shoot deposit \naround the circular shape d wound.  \nPellets were found sprayed inside the cranium . Two w ads were \nalso found inside the skull cavity.  There were multiple fractures of \nthe skull and brain haemorrhages  due to pellet injuries.  These \nmultiple pellets and wads , which are part of the cartridge  found in the \nskull cavity , were later sent for forensic examination.  \nAs per the postmortem examination, the  entry wound was in \nthe skull and the exit wound was in the left infraorbital region.  \nIt may be noted that l eft infraorbital region is the area of the \nface located below the left eye socket.   \nThis is indicative of the fact that the bullet entered from behind  \nthe head .   \nAccording to PW-28, the Medical Officer,  the cause of death \nwas due to injury to a vital organ leading to neurogenic shock , which \nis the primary cause , and secondary cause was hypovolemic shock \ndue to intracranial haemorrhage . \nPW 28 , after receipt of the ballistic report from the Forensic \nScience Laboratory , Bangalore, gave his final opinion that the cause  \nPage 50 of 76 \n  \nof death is ballistic injuries to the vital organ leading to neurogenic \nand hypovolemic shock.  \n10.7.2  We will now examine the evidence of the ball istic \nexpert N . G. Prabhakar, PW-30, who examined the double barrel gun \nwhich was  recovered  at the instance of the appellant and other \nmaterials , i.e. two spent 12 bore  cartridg es, two plastic wads, lead \npellets sent to him  for examination . Two live 12 bore cartridges \nwhich were purchased by the police for testing of the gun were also \nsent. \n10.7.3        These  articles were received by the FSL,  Bangalore on \n19.09.2006 and were examined  on the same day and upon \nexamination , PW -30 furnished the following opinion  which is \nreproduced verbatim : \n“1) The D.B.B.L  gun in Article No. 1 b ears signs of discharge.  \n2) The D.B.B.L  gun in Article No. 1 was in working \ncondition at the time of examination.  \n3) The cartridges in Article no. 3 were live and the same can \nbe fired through the D.B.B.L  Gun in Article No. 1.   \n4) The effective range of the D.B.B.L  gun in Article No. 1 is \nabout 40 yards.  \n5) The cartridges case marked as 2(a) and 2 ( b) in Article No. \n2 have been fired through the right and left barrel of the \nD.B.B.L  Gun in Article No. 1.  \nPage 51 of 76 \n  \n6) The wads and lead pellets in Article  Nos. 4 & 5 are the \ncomponents of 12-bore cartridges and the same could  have \nbeen fired through the D.B.B.L  Gun in Article No. 1. ” \n \nIt may be noted that Article No.1 was the  D.B.B.L  gun \nrecovered at  the instance of the appellant, Article No.2 consist ed of \nspent cartridges also recovered at the instance of the appellant .  \nArticle No.3 consist ed of two live cartridges which were purchased \nby the police for testing of the gun.  \n The said ballistic expert was subject ed to intense cross \nexamination . However , his evidence could not be shaken  in respect \nof any of the opinion s given by him . \n10.7.4  In our considered view, the afores aid forensic evidence \nbased on ballistic  tests is not only crucial and critical in \nunderstanding the case , but also seals the fate of the appellant , which  \nestablishes  the fact that the gun  recovered at the instance of the \nappellant  was used in causing the bullet injury to the deceased  which \nled to his death .  \n It is not the case of the defence  that such a gun is readily and \neasily available and can be used by anybody. One needs to have a \nlicense to possess such a gun. It is not an ordinary weapon of crime  \nlike a knife which is readily available which can be used to injure a  \nPage 52 of 76 \n  \nperson  fatally .  In the present case , the weapon of crime is directly \ntraceable to the appellant , who had taken it from his grandfather  as it \nwas recovered at the instance of the appellant as per the evidence of \nthe Investigation Officer, PW -31 corroborated by the panch witness, \nPW-6.  \n10.7.5  The double barrel gun was recovered  at the instance of \nthe appellant, as witnessed by the seizure witness es, namely,  Ismail \nMohammad  Dange (PW-6) and Villas Macche ndra Davari ( PW-7). \nPW-7, however, turned hostile and stated that nothing was recovered \nat the instance of the appellant in his presence .  On the other hand, \nPW-6 remained consistent, both in his examination in chief as well \nas in the cross examination that the appellant in his presence \nproduced the gun, one live cart ridge, two spent  cartridges  from his \nhouse.  Other articles like a handbag, Hero Honda Motorcycle were  \nalso produced by the appellant  in presence of PW -6.  Even though \nPW-6 was declared hostile  as he did not fully support the prosecution  \ncase, yet as far as the recovery of the aforesaid articles is concerned, \nhe stood his ground and he remain ed consistent  even in his cross \nexamination .  The said witness testified  that the  appellant  led the \nPolice and other  witnesses to the spot from  where  the appellant shot  \nPage 53 of 76 \n  \nthe gun.  Thus, the recovery of the gun and cartridges at the instance \nof the appellant  was proved.  \n It may also be noticed that ballistic  expert , on examination of \nthe two spent cartridges recovered along with the gun  at the instance \nof the appellant , gave his opinion that these were fired from the gun .  \n10.7.6     The double barrel gun, one live, and two spent cartridges,  \nand handbag w as recovered at the instance of the appellant from the \nhouse of the grandfather of the appellant where the appellant lived . \nHence, these materials or “facts” recovered would come within the \nscope of Section 27 of the Evidence Act. Since  the discovery of these \nmaterials was proved, it was incumbent upon the appellant to explain \nthe discovery and  attributes of the articles, more particularly , the gun \nand spent cartridges. Since it was within the special knowledge  of the \nappellant how these spent cartridges were kept in the house and how \nthe gun was used for discharge before it was recovered, the appellant \nowes an obligation to explain the same. Even if the appellant did not \nexplain the same, at least his grandfather, PW -20 who was the owner \nof the gun was obligated to explain it as he was living with the \nappellant,  and he was the real owner of the gun. There was no such \nexplanation offe red either by  the appellant or his grandfather ( PW-\n20), how the spent cartridges were  found and how the gun was used   \nPage 54 of 76 \n  \nfor discharge . The grandfather, PW -20 merely stated that the \nappellant did not take the gun on 10.07.2006 and used it. It was \nnatural on the part of the grandfather to protect his grandson,  but he \nwas supposed to know of about the use of the gun a s well as the \nrecovery of the spent cartri dges. Thus, the failure  to explain the \nrecovery of the gun and its discharge , and recovery of the spent \ncartridge certainly implicates the appellant, specifically when the \nballistic expert gave his opinion that the lead p ellets and wads \nrecovered from the brain skull could be used from the aforesaid gun  \nand the gun had sho wn signs of discharge .  \n As held by this Court in Mukesh & Anr. Vs. NCT of Delhi \n& Ors. (2017) 6 SCC 1 , when recoveries are made under Section 27 \nof the Evidence Act, the accused should explain how he came into \npossession of the incriminating articles.  \n10.7.7      The clear scientific evidence that the pellets and w ads \nfound in the skull cavity of the deceased could be fired from the \naforesaid  gun recovered at the instance of the appellant  and the gun \nbore signs of discharge and was in a working condition clearly links \nthe appellant  to the crime.   \nPage 55 of 76 \n  \n10.7.8    Even though the appellant had tried to make out a case that \nnobody had seen the appellant carrying the gun, in our opinion , the \nsaid contention is devoid of merit in view of the evidence of the \nforensic expert who examined the gun who clearly stated that gun \ncan be dismantled. There is the evidence of PW -5, Ashok Ram \nJamadar , who had given the testimony of seeing the appellant along \nwith the deceased in the night of 10 .07.2006 going in a motorcycle \ntowards Shiraguppi  that the deceased was carrying a bag. If the \ndouble barrel gun could be dismantled , it certainly can be kept in the \nbag.  Hence,  merely because there is no evidence of any witness \nseeing  the gun being  carried by the appellant , it cannot be fatal to the \nprosecution case.  \n10.7.9     Once it has come to the fore , based on scientific evidence \nthat the gun which was recovered at the instance of the appellant was \nin working condition, that it had shown sign of discharge, and the \npellets and w ads found in the skull cavity of the deceased  could be \nfired from the said gun, in the absence of any explanation by the \nappellant or by the owner of the gun, the grandfather of the appellant, \nthe only logical  inference that can be drawn in the circumstances is \nthat it was the appellant who had used the said gun causing the bullet \ninjury on the deceased  which led to his death.   \nPage 56 of 76 \n  \n10.8   Under th ese circumstances , since  it has been proved that the \nappellant  was seen last together with the deceased  going on a \nmotorcycle  carrying  a bag, and there is also evidence that there was \nan argument  between them  of certain monetary transaction and \ndiscussion about going for hunting before the y left together, in our \nopinion , there cannot be any doubt that the appellant was responsible \nfor causing the death of the deceased  by use of the double -barrel gun.   \n10.9     There is also a specific finding by the Trial Court and the \nHigh Court that the appellant remained in abscondence from \n11.07.2006 till he was arrested by the police on 22. 07.2006.   \n10.9.1     It is on record that the appellant and the deceased were  \nfriends .  They were not strangers. Thus, t his act of absconding b y the \nappellant , rather than helping and cooperating with the family of his \nfriend, in spite of persistent enquiries from the father of the deceased \nis a clear indication of his  guilt.  \n The Investigating Officer, PW -31 stated that after recording \nthe statements of the witnesses who saw the deceased and appellant \ntogether last on 10.7.2006, the police searched for the appellant going \nto various places at Miraj, Sangali , Hiruyuru, Bangalore but the \nappellant could not be traced. On 22.07.2006  at 6.00 AM, after PW - \nPage 57 of 76 \n  \n31 received an anonymous call to the effect that the appellant has \ncome to Miraj, he was arrested there and brought to the police station.  \n10.9.2        It is trite that mere absconding by itself does not constitute \na guilty mind as even  an innocent man may feel panicky and  may \nseek to evade the police when wrongly suspected of being  \ninvolvement as  an insti nct of self-preservation . But the act of \nabscondence  is certainly a relevant  piece of evidence  to be \nconsidered along with other evidence and is a conduct under Section \n8 of the Evidence Act, 1872, which points  to his guilty mind .  The \nneedle of suspicion gets strengthened by the act  [See: Matr u @ \nGirish Chandra vs. State of U ttar Pradesh , (1971) 2 SCC 75 ]. \n10.9.3         It is also on record that the appellant did not merely remain \nin hiding but also misled  his relatives and of the family of the \ndeceased  and his friends  about his whereabouts .  \n It is in evidence that when PW-2, the father of the deceased \ntelephoned the house of the appellant  on the night of 10.07.2006 , he \nwas informed that the appellant was not at home . PW -2 again visited \nthe appellant ’s house  in the morning of 11.07.2006 to enquire about \nthe deceased . The appellant inform ed PW-2 that he had left the \ndeceased  near the water tank situated near the bus stand the previous  \nPage 58 of 76 \n  \nevening and he d id not know where the deceased had gone . Further , \nwhen PW -2 again went to the house of the appellant next day on \n12.07.2006 to inquire about the whereabouts of his missing son , the \nappellant was not found in the house . PW -2 however, met his uncle , \nnamely, Dhan anjay Chavan  who informed PW-2 that the appellant  \nhad gone to Pune in search of job  and said Dhananjay Chavan  gave \nthe mobile  number of one Devraj Sutar (PW -14), a friend  of the \nappellant who was sta ted to be stayin g in Pune. When the father of \nthe deceased contacted the said Devraj Sutar (PW -14) on his mobile \nphone , and inquired about the appellant , the said Devraj Sutar (PW-\n14) informed the father of the deceased that the appellant had not \ncome to meet him. Later when the father of the deceased rang up \nDevraj Sutar  (PW-14) again, he informed  PW-2 that he (PW-14) was \nnot in Pune but in Ahmed nagar. PW-2, the father of the deceased  \nthen confronted Devraj Sutar  as to why he was lying, Devraj Sutar  \ntold him that the appellant had asked him to do so. It was thereafter \nthat the father of the deceased filed a missing report.   \n We have also gone through the missing report filed by PW -2. \nThe narration of the incidents in the missing report about the acts of \nthe appellant in misleading and avoidance substantially corroborates  \nPage 59 of 76 \n  \nwhat PW-2 had deposed about the appellant before the Trial Court, \nthus lending credibility to his testimony before the Court.  \n10.9.4   When we critically examine  the evidence of Devraj Sutar  \n(PW-14), we find that he corroborates the testimony of PW -2, the \nfather of the deceased.  \nPW-14 testified that he was a classmate and friend of the \nappellant and knew him .  \nPW-14 stated that on 11 .07.2006 he received a call from the \nappellant at around 9:00  pm and the appellant asked him to tell his \nuncle if he contacts him o n the  phone to inform him that he (PW -14) \nis in Pune, though PW -14 was in Ahmednagar. PW -14 also state d \nthat the appellant appeared to be frightened  and asked him to tell a \nlie and  there after disconnected the phone. PW-14 further testified \nthat on the next day on 12 .07.2006 he received a phone call from the \nuncle of the appellant who enquired  about the appellant , to which \nPW-14 told him that the appellant  had not come . On the second call \nreceived from the uncle of the appellant , PW-14 narrated the actual  \nfacts by stating that he was actually in Ahmed nagar and not in Pune \nand the appellant had not come to him . He stated that thereafter , he \nwas contacted over phone by the police who asked him to come to  \nPage 60 of 76 \n  \nMiraj Police Station  where he went and gave his statement .  He  also \nstated that after 3 -4 days of the recording of his statement , the police \nagain asked him to report to the Kagawad Police Station whe re he \nwas informed that one Vikram Shinde has been murdered.  \n10.9.5    In our opinion, the evidence of PW -14 is not only highly \nrelevant but critical to support  the case of the prosecution that the \nappellant had been in hiding and was misleading others about his \nwhereabouts and he remained in abscondence  from 1 1.07.2006 till \n22.07.2006 .  \n His testimony also appears to be truthful.  \nIt is to be noted that PW -14 had specifically deposed that he \nwas a friend of the appellant , and he did not know the deceased . PW-\n14 stated that he was a classmate of the appellant,  and he had \nundertaken diploma course along with the appellant.   \nHe did not have any idea of the missing of Vikram Shinde and \nthe subsequent discovery of the dead body of Vikram Shinde.  PW-\n14 came to know of the murder of Vikram Shinde only when he was \ncalled at the Kagawad Police Station after about a week of his \nrecording of statement at Miraj Police Station.  Hence, there is no \nreason to doubt the credibility of his evidence.  Rather, he , being a  \nPage 61 of 76 \n  \nfriend of the appellant, it would not have been  surprising if he had \nturned hostile as in the case of some of the prosecution witnesses  like \nSandip Sandalage (PW -18). According to the Prosecution, the \nappellant had allegedly made an extra -judicial confession in the \npresence  of Sandip Sandalage (PW -18) who was a friend of the \nappellant, but PW -18 turned hostile and resiled from his previous \nstatement. Hence, we have not taken into account his evidence in our  \nconsideration.  However,  Devraj Sutar (PW -14), despite being a \nfriend of the appellant  did not turn hostile but supported the \nprosecution case.  Thus,  there cannot be any doubt about the \ncredibility of the evidence  of PW -14, Devraj Sutar .  \n10.10      As regards the recovery of gold chain, from the possession \nof the appellant, the same is proved as per evidence  of the \nInvestigating Officer, PW-31, and seizure witness, Ismail \nMohammad Dange , PW-6. PW-6 stated  that on 22.07.2006 when he \nwas called to the Police Station, the appellant  had produced a gold \nchain and at th at time, a goldsmith (PW-13) was present who tested \nand measured  it.  The said PW-13 also corroborates the testimony of \nPW-6 though the other panch w itness , PW-7, Vilas Macchendra \nDavari , does not support the same.   \nPage 62 of 76 \n  \nIn respect of seizure of mobile phone, the shopkeeper, Shiv \nKumar, PW -25 had denied having purchased it from the appellant , \nthough th ere was no explanation of the recovery of a paper containing \nthe driving licence particulars and photograph of the appellant with \nthe signature of the shop  owner and seal of the shop . Nevertheless,  \nwe give the benefit of doubt in regard of proof of recovery of mobile \nphone from the appellant , yet the fact remains that the said witness \nPW-25 admitted that the signature on the said document was his and \nthe seal pertains to his shop , which  indicate s certain  relationship of \nthe appellant with the said shopkeeper, PW -25.  \n Be that as it may,  in our opinion, this may not have much  \nbearing on the case in view of the recovery of the gun, cartridges, \nmotorcycle, bag and gold chain at the instance of the appellant , which \nclearly points the finger of culpability to wards  the appellant .   \n10.11    This takes us to the other contentious issue of motive which \nprompted the appellant to commit the crime.  According to the \nProsecution, the appellant murdered the deceased by using firearms \nas he was upset by the non-repayment of the loan taken from him by \nthe deceased.   \nPage 63 of 76 \n  \n10.11.1     The Prosecution case is that the appellant had taken a \ncertain amount from Ravindra S. Chavan, PW -19 to lend it to the \ndeceased. However , Ravindra Chavan denied having given any \nmoney to the appellant. In view of the above evidence, the Trial Court \nheld that the monetary transaction cannot  be said to be proved .  On \nthe other hand, the High Court based on the other evidence held the \nsame to be proved.   \nIn this regard,  we may scrutinize the evidence of other witnes s, \nnamely,  Ashok R Shinde (PW -4), the auto -rickshaw driver who \nallegedly heard arguments between the appellant and the deceased \nregarding certain monetary matter . Even if the exact amount of the \nmonetary transaction cannot be ascertained  as held by the Trial \nCourt , it is on record that there was an  argument between them \nrelating to money and insulting word s being  used by the deceased to \nthe appellant which was heard by PW -4. This interaction  would show \nthat there was an element of grudge by  the appellant against  the \ndeceased  because of certain monetary dispute which constituted the \nmotive behind the crime.  \n10.11.2 Even  if it is held that there was no such monetary \ntransaction between the appellant  and the deceased , the same may \nnot materially affect the Prosecution case.  As is well known, the  \nPage 64 of 76 \n  \nmotive is something that is very difficult to prove as it remains hidden \nin the deep recess of the mind of the person  concerned and in the \nabsence of any open declaration by the person concerned himself, the \nmotive has to be  inferred  from the activities and conduct of the \nperson. From the evidence of Ashok R Shinde (PW -4), it can be \nstated that there was a certain argument between the appellant and \nthe deceased,  and the deceased was heard using  insulting words to \nthe appellant. It is to be noted that the PW -4 is known to both the \nappellant and the deceased,  and he was having good terms with the \nfamily members of both the deceased and appellant and as such it \nwill be highly improbable that this witness would give false \nstatement favouring  the appellant and against the deceased. Nothing \nwas suggested during his cross examination of h im being  inimical to \nthe appellant.   \n10.11.3 The law is now well-settled that while proof of motive \ncertainly strengthens the prosecution case  based on circumstantial \nevidence , failure to prove the same cannot be fatal.  In this regard , \none may refer to  G. Parshwanath vs. State of Karnataka  2010  (8) \nSCC 593  in which it was held as follows:  \n“45.  The argument that in absence of motive on the part of \nthe appellant to kill the deceased benefit of reasonable doubt \nshould be given, cannot be accepted. First of all every \nsuspicion is not a doubt. Only reasonable doubt gives benefit  \nPage 65 of 76 \n  \nto the accused and not the doubt of a vacillating judge. Very \noften a motive is alleged to indicate the high degree of \nprobability that the offence was committed by the person who \nwas prompted by the motive. In a case when the motive \nalleged against accuse d is fully established, it provides \nfoundational material to connect the chain of circumstances. \nIt afforts a key on a pointer to scan the evidence in the case \nin that perspective and as a satisfactory circumstance of \ncorroboration. However, in a case base d on circumstantial \nevidence where proved circumstances complete the chain of \nevidence, it cannot be said that in absence of motive, the \nother proved circumstances are of  no consequence. The \nabsence of motive, however, puts the court on its guard to \nscruti nize the circumstances more carefully to ensure that \nsuspicion and conjecture do not take place of legal proof. \nThere is no absolute legal proposition of law that in the \nabsence of any motive an accused cannot be convicted \nunder  Section 302  IPC. Effect of absence of motive would \ndepend on the facts of each case. Therefore, this Court \nproposes to examine the question of motive which prompted \nthe appellant to commit the crime in question. ”  \n \n \n10.12  The present case is clearly one that is founded on \ncircumstantial evidence . By its very nature , circumstantial evidence \nas opposed to direct evidence , is the inference one draws  from the \nexistence of a fact based on certain established fact/circumstance.  \nThis process invariably involves intuitive reasoning, proper \nunderstanding of human behaviour  and psychology . This reasoning  \nhas to be rational, probative and which accords with the natural \nhuman behaviour . At the same time, there will always be certain \nsubjective element s, which however, cannot be in the nature of \nsurmise or conjecture . The inference may not lead to absolute \ncertainty as we are dealing with human behaviour and reconstructing   \nPage 66 of 76 \n  \na past incident in hindsight. Naturally, when  evaluating the prove n \ncircumstances  for drawing certain inferences therefrom , a logical , \nrational and pragmatic approach must be adopted without being too \ntechnical , pedantic , or seeking absolute proof , for this principle of \ncircumstantial evidence is not based on statutory provision .  \nThus, b ased on lived human experiences and human  \nbehaviour , if any supposition of fact is clearly inferabl e from an \nestablished fact, the inferred position of fact  should be adopted  as \ncorrect . Law does not require that a fact requires to be proved on \nabsolute terms bereft of all doubts. What law contemplates is that  for \na fact to be considered proven , it must eliminate any reasonable \ndoubt. Reasonable doubt does not mean any trivial, fanciful or \nimaginary doubt, but doubt based on reason and common sense \ngrowing out of the evidence in the case. A fact is considered proved \nif the court, after reviewing the evidence, either believes it exists or \ndeems its existence probable enough that a prudent person would act \non the assumption that it exists.      \n10.12.1     It is also settled that where the evidence is circumstantial \nin nature, the circumstances from which the inference of  guilt is to \nbe drawn , should be fully established.  In other words, each of the \ncircumstances  from which certain inferences are sought  to be drawn ,  \nPage 67 of 76 \n  \nis required  to be proved  in accordance with law , and there cannot be \nany element of surmise and conjecture , and each of these \ncircumstances so proved must form a complete chain without any \nbreak to clearly point to the guilt of the accused person .  The court \nhas to examine the cumulative effect of the existence of these \ncircumstances , which would point  to the guilt of the accused , though \nany single circumstance may not in itself be sufficient to prove the \noffence.  Thus, if the combined effect of all these circumstances , each \nof which ha s been independently  proved , establish es the guilt of the \naccused , then the conviction based on such circumstance s can be \nsustained . These circumstances so proved must be consistent only \nwith the hypothesis with the guilt of the accused and should exclude \nevery hypothesis except the one sought to be proved.     \n Thus , if upon evaluation of a set of proved circumstances \nconsistent with understandable  and socially recognised human \nbehaviour, as a cumulative consequence, a clear and definitive \npattern emerges which irresistibly points to the culpability of the \naccused person, we see no reason why we should not accept such an \ninferred conclusion to be correct to fasten criminal liability on the \naccused. On the other hand, if  such an inference is sought to be \nassailed on the ground of any doubt, the doubt must be a reasonable  \nPage 68 of 76 \n  \none consistent with human behaviour under the circumstances  of the \ncase and not fanciful , abstract speculation  or imagination.  \n10.12.2     Keeping the aforesaid principles in mind , if we consider \nall these circumstances , all of which , in our opinion,  have been \nproved in the present case, the cumulative effect of these would  \nclearly demonstrate  that no other person other than the appellant \ncould have caused the fatal injur y to the deceased  by use of fire arms . \nAs the saying goes , while m en may lie, circumstances do not.  \n10.13     As discussed above, it has been proved through cogent and \ncredible evidence that the appellant was last seen together with the \ndeceased on  10.07.2006  and though the dead body of the deceased \nwas discovered on  13.07.2006 , death had occurred around the time \nthe deceased went missing and during this intervening period, the \nwhereabouts of the deceased  could not be ascertained. On the other \nhand,  the appellant had been hiding and misleading his relatives and \nfriends about his whereabouts for which the Trial Court and the High \nCourt had rightly inferred his guilty mind.  \n10.13.1      The other incriminating circumstance is the recovery of \npellets and wads from the brain and skull of the deceased . The post-\nmortem report indicates that the deceased died of bullet injury. T he  \nPage 69 of 76 \n  \nexit wound was below the left eye  socket , which would show that the \nvictim was fired at from behind. As per the forensic expert, t he size \nof the injury on the head of the appellant corroborates with the injury \nthat may be cause d by firing from  the double barrel gun. What is, \nhowever, of utmost and critical significance is the recovery of the \npellets and wads from the brain inside the skull of the deceased and \nthe opinion of the ballistic  expert that these pellets and wads can be \nfired from the double barrel gun which was recovered at the instance \nof the appellant which belongs to the appellant ’s grandfather.  The \nballistic expert had  also given  his opinion that there is evidence of \ndischarge of the gun  and the gun wa s in working condition .  \n10.13.2     Further,  as per the ballistic expert, the spent two 12 bore \nD.B.B.L  cartridges recovered at the instance of the appellant were \nfired from the same gun and that the pellets and wads recovered from \nthe body were parts of the 12 bore cartridge.  \n10.14      Since the gun and empty p ellets were recovered from the \nhouse of the appellant/his grandfather, the incriminating evidence \nclearly indicate s the involvement of the appellant . As the a ppellant \nhad access to the said gun  and since it was recovered at his instance,  \nit was upon him to explain the circumstances in which the gun \nshowed signs of discharge and how the empty p ellets were recovered   \nPage 70 of 76 \n  \nas required under Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act  which \nprovides that when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any \nperson, the burden of proving that fact is upon him .  As there was \nballistic evidence that the p ellets and wads recovered from the cavity \nof the skull of the deceased  show ed a link, the appellant had an \nobligation to explain the circumstances. Even if the appellant may \nclaim that he was not the owner of the gun, his grandfather owned a \nduty to explain  the position.  \nAll the prosecution witnesses , including the forensic expert  \nand ballistic ex pert had been subjected to intense cross examination \nwith the endeavour to shake their credibility, yet, the appellant has \nchosen not to lead any evidence  except for denying any role in the \ncrime .  \n10.14.1  The appellant's connection to the case deepened as \nvarious forensic and ballistic analyses were introduced. The recovery \nof the weapon and supporting evidence, including the corroborative \ntestimonies of prosecution witnesses, established a compelling \nnarrat ive. While motive is often challenging to substantiate, the chain \nof circumstantial evidence in this case continuously narrowed the \nfocus toward the appellant's culpability. The scientific analysis of the \ngun and its discharged state, alongside th e recovered empty p ellets,  \nPage 71 of 76 \n  \nplayed a critical role in aligning the timeline of events surrounding \nthe crime.  \n10.15     It is true that even in cases based on circumstantial evidence, \nthe prosecution cannot depend on the false alibi  or unprove n defence \nplea since  the onus is always on the prosecution to prove the \nprosecution case and the onus never shifts to the accused.  However, \nin such circumstances where prosecution has been able to prove on \nthe basis of cogent evidence that the weapon of crime was traced to \nthe accused, as in the present case , it was incumbent upon th e \nappellant to explain the circumstances  of the recovery of the weapon \nwith which a linkage has been established with the injury suffered by \nthe deceased through scientific evidence .  However, apart from \nclaiming ignorance and denying the various  incriminating evidence \npresented during the trial, the appellant chose not to adduce  any \nevidence to explain these circumstances.  Thus, his silence and \nfailure  to explain any of the incriminatory  circumstances , would \nstrengthen the prosecution case based on circumstantial evidence \nagainst him  as proved by the Prosecution .   \n10.15.1     In this regard, we may also refer to the decision in this \nCourt rendered in Trimukh Maroti Kirkan v. State of Maharashtra \n(2006) 10 SCC 681  it was held that where the circumstantial  \nPage 72 of 76 \n  \nevidence is the basis for any case ,  where no eyewitness account  is \navailable , and when the incriminating circumstances are put to the \naccused, if the accused does offer  any explanation or the explanation \nthat is found to be fals e, it provides an additional link to the chain of \ncircumstances as observed in para 21 of the aforesaid decision which \nis reproduced herein below : -  \n “21. In a case based on circumstantial evidence where \nno eyewitness account is available, there is another \nprinciple of law which must be kept in mind. The \nprinciple is that when an incriminating circumstance is \nput to the accused and the said accused eithe r offers no \nexplanation or offers an explanation which is found to be \nuntrue, then the same becomes an additional link in the \nchain of circumstances to make it complete. This view has \nbeen taken in a catena of decisions of this Court. \n[See State of T.N.  v. Rajendran  [(1999) 8 SCC 679 : 2000 \nSCC (Cri) 40] (SCC para 6);  State of U.P .  v. Dr. \nRavindra Prakash Mittal  [(1992) 3 SCC 300 : 1992 SCC \n(Cri) 642 : AIR 1992 SC 2045] (SCC para 39 : AIR para \n40); State of Maharashtra  v. Suresh  [(2000) 1 SCC 471 : \n2000 S CC (Cri) 263] (SCC para 27);  Ganesh Lal  v. State \nof Rajasthan  [(2002) 1 SCC 731 : 2002 SCC (Cri) 247] \n(SCC para 15) and  Gulab Chand  v. State of M.P .  [(1995) \n3 SCC 574 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 552] (SCC para 4).]  \n \n10.16     We may not also lose sight of the significance of the \nprovision of Section 313 of the CrPC  in the case.  As a trial comes to \na conclusive phase and all the evidence are adduced by the \nprosecution , the veracity and credibility of which are tested with the \ntool of cross examination  and w hen a certain clear picture emerges \nbased on the incriminating materials on evidence, as a procedural  \nPage 73 of 76 \n  \nsafeguard, the court draws the attention of the accused to these \nincriminating evidence to enable the accused to explain these facts \nand circumstances which point to his guilt. While the accused is not \nobligated to answer th e questions put to him and still can maintain \nhis silence or deny the evidence, yet silence or evasive or wrong \nanswer s to the questions put by the court provides a perspective to \nthe court in properly evaluat ing the incriminating materials which \nhave been brought forth by the prosecution by drawing necessary \ninference  including an adverse one . [See, Manu Sao v. State of \nBihar , (2010) 12 SCC 310 ]. \n10.16.1   Examination of an accused under Section 313 CrPC is an \nimportant component of the process of judicial scrutiny of the \nevidence sought to be relied upon by the prosecution against an \naccused. At the time of indictment and framing of charges against an \naccused , the untested evidence marshalled by the investigating \nauthority in the course of the investigation is laid bare before the \naccused , who would have an idea as to the nature of evidence and \ncase being built up against him by the prosecution. This is to enable \nthe accused to prepare and strategize  his defence . He will have all the \nopportunities to discredit any prosecution witness or question any \nevidence through the tool of cross examination. He  will thereafter  \nPage 74 of 76 \n  \nhave the opportunity to lead his defence evidence if any. It is in this \ncontext that the answer s given by an accused assume  great \nsignificance in assessing the evidence by the court.  \n10.16.2     In the present case, despite  the incriminating evidence \nwhich ha s come up against him has been pointed out to him by the \nCourt, he has not explained  any of these but merely denied or feigned \nignorance to which necessary inference can be drawn against him.   \n11. CONCLUSION  \n11.1 For the reasons discussed above, on consideration of the \ncircumstantial evidences and other prove n facts, in our considered \nopinion , a clear pa ttern emerges  out of the circumstances  so proved  \nwith inferential and logical links  which  unmistakably points to the \nguilt of the appellant for committing murder of the deceased Vikram \nShinde , punishable under Section 302 of the IPC and also for \ncommitting offence s under Section 404 of the IPC and Sections 3 and \n5 of the Arms Act,1959  punishable under Sections 25 and 27 of the \nArms Act . \n These proved circumstances considered individually or taken \ntogether do not indicate the involvement of  anyone else other than \nthe appellant .  \nPage 75 of 76 \n  \n In the circumstances so proved, the possibility of any other \nperson  being responsible  for the death being  ruled out , it can be safely \nsaid that  the Prosecution has been able to prove  the charges  against \nthe appellant beyond reasonable doubt . There can thus be no doubt \nthat no one else other than the appellant could have committed the \ncrime .  \n11.2  For the foregoing reasons , we are of the view that  no material \nillegality ha s been committed by the Trial Court and the High Court \nin appreciating the evidence against the appellant nor  it can be said \nthat any gross injustice has been caused to the appellant by the \nimpugned judgment by misreading or ignoring any material \nevidence .  \n11.3  We are, therefore, satisfied  that the conviction of the appellant \nby the Trial Court which the High Court upheld does not warrant any \ninterference from this Court except for setting aside the conviction \nunder Section 404 of the IPC as regards recovery of the Nokia Mobile \nPhone , of which we give the benefit of doubt  to the appellant , but \nsustain  the conviction of the appellant under Section s 302 and 404 of \nthe IPC as re gards murder of the deceased and misappropriation of \ngold chain by the appellant  and under Sections 25 and 27 of the Arms \nAct, 1959  for unlawful possession and use of the gun .   \nPage 76 of 76 \n  \n11.4  Resultantly, the appeal is dismissed  and the impugned \njudgment and order of the High Court of Karnatak a, Circuit Bench at \nDharwad passed on 06.12.2010 in Criminal Appeal No.  666 of 2007 \nis upheld to the extent indicated above.   \nConsequently,  bail bonds furnished by the appellant stand \ncancelled  and the appellant who had been released on bail is directed \nto surrender  before the Trial Court forthwith  to undergo the \nremaining  period of sentence awarded by the Trial Court as affirmed  \nby the High Court . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                    ……………………………J.  \n  (SURYA KANT)  \n \n \n                                                  \n….……………….…………………………J.  \n                           (NONGMEIKAPAM KOTISWAR SINGH)  \n \n \nNEW DELHI;  \nMAY  30, 2025."
